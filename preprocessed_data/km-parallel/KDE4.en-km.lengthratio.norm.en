Script Writing
Bindings
This example shows how to catch a missing dependency in Ruby:
begin require'Korundum 'rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' ` kdialog --sorry '#{error} '` exit end
Getting Started: The Templates
Controlling & amarok; With DCOP
Scripts can control Amarok by calling some of its DCOP functions. The easiest way to invoke a DCOP function is by using the "dcop" command line utility, which is part of every KDE distribution.
Here is an example for increasing the master volume:
dcop amarok player volumeUp
Most scripting languages allow to execute external programs, with a function like exec(). This way the "dcop" utility can be invoked easily. Here is a simple Python example:
import os os. system("dcop amarok player volumeDown ")
Notifications
The following notifications are sent by & amarok;:
configure Tells the script to show its configuration dialog. The script must handle the storing and loading of configuration options by itself. When a script is started, Amarok sets its working directory to the folder where all data should be stored.
engineStateChange: empty_BAR_idle_BAR_paused_BAR_playing Signals a change in the engine's state.
trackChange Signals the start of a new track. The script may then use DCOP functions to query further information about the track, e. g. metadata and the length.
volumeChange newVolume Signals a change of the master volume level. The volume is an integer with a range of 0-100.
Script Termination
Packaging
& amarok; 's Script Manager is able to install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. Packages are just normal tarballs (. tar), optionally compressed with bzip2 (. bz2). We strongly recommend using a filename like myscript. amarokscript. tar. bz2, so the user can easily identify the package as an Amarok script.
The tarball's content must be organized as follows:
myscript/ README myscript. py (executable) somemodule. py foo. data...
File permissions
The main script must have executable (+x) permissions set, while additional modules which the script loads should not be executable. To preserve the file permissions in the tarball, you should use tar with the -p flag:
tar -cf myscript. amarokscript. tar -p myscript
Distributing
When the package is finished, you can upload it to www. kde-apps. org, and add the link to the & amarok; Wiki Scripts Page. For the kde-apps entry you should use the amarok; Scripts category.
Sets the comment used for umounting media device.

Configuring & amarok;
& amarok; is easily configured from the configuration dialog. The configuration dialog has multiple tabs for setting up different functions of & amarok;.
The configuration dialog can be found by selecting Configure & amarok; in the player RMB; menu, or by selecting Settings Configure & amarok;....
General Options
The General Options tab is divided into two sections, General Options and Playlist Options.
General Options
In the General Options section you can configure some basic & amarok; options.
Show splash-screen on startup: displays the splash screen when & amarok; starts.
Show tray icon: enables the display of the system tray icon.
Flash tray icon: enables animation of the system tray icon.
Show player window (like XMMS): Turns on the XMMS-like Player Window. When un-checked, only the Playlist Window, which resembles a display mode similar to the Juk interface, is shown.
Use Moodbar: only visible when & amarok; is compiled with moodbar support. This turns on the experimental moodbar support.
Make Moodier: only visible when & amarok; is compiled with moodbar support. It changes the color scheme used for the moodbar.
Store Mood data files with music: only visible when & amarok; is compiled with moodbar support. When enabled, this option allows saving of. mood files in the same location as the corresponding audio file. When disabled, the. mood files are saved within the & amarok; settings directory; usually ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ amarok/ moodbar/.
Default size of cover previews: allows adjusting the size of the album cover image in the Context Browser.
External web browser: allows choosing what & amarok; uses to open external links via a drop-down menu listing the installed browsers.
Use another browser: allows you to specify the location to a browser not listed in the above menu.
Playlist-Window Options
In the Playlist-Window Options section you can configure playlist behavior.
Remember current playlist on exit: check this if you want to save your current playlist when you exit & amarok; and reload it the next time.
Keep active song visible on track change: this option automatically scrolls the Playlist, when a track changes, to ensure that the currently playing track is always visible.
Show statusbar: enables the & amarok; statusbar in the Playlist Window.
Configure Appearance
The Appearance tab allows you to configure how & amarok; looks. The tab is divided into three sections.
Fonts
The fonts section is used for selecting the fonts to be used with & amarok;. Selecting the Use custom fonts checkbox enables font selection buttons. The available choices are for the Player Window, the Playlist Window, and the Context Browser. By clicking the Choose... button you can select a font from the dialog.
Color Scheme
The current KDE color-scheme choice forces & amarok; use the current KDE color scheme.
The classic Amarok, "funky-monkey", theme choice uses & amarok; 's original color scheme.
Custom color scheme enables color selectors to choose custom foreground and background colors for & amarok;.
Configure Playback
The Configure Playback tab provides an interface for configuring your audio playback characteristics.
Transition Behavior
You can configure how & amarok; transitions from one song to the next.

Configure Engine
The Configure Engine tab allows you to select a sound engine from the list in the drop-down menu. Available options vary among the engines selected. See the "Requirements" section for different engines available.
Configure Collection
Collection Folders
Scan folders recursively: tells & amarok; to scan the selected folders and all of their sub-folders.
Watch folders for changes: allows & amarok; to watch the selected folders for filesystem changes (for example, added or deleted music files). An incremental scan is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.
Import Playlists: allows & amarok; to import any playlists (. pls and. m3u files) it finds while scanning for tracks to add to your collection. You will find these on the "Playlists" sidebar.
Collection Database
The Collection Database section is used to select a database to use for the collection. Use the Engine: combo box to select from either Sqlite or MySql. If MySql is selected, additional configuration is required in the MySql Configuration section.
The MySql Configuration section is for configuring what database & amarok; uses, and where it is located. First is the Hostname:, which is where the MySql database is located. Next is the Port:, which is the network port used when connecting to the database. The Name: option, is the actual database to connect to.
Use the Username: and Password: text input boxes to specify the username and password used for connecting to the MySql database.
Configure Last. fm
Configure last. fm Screenshot
The last. fm settings tab configures the last. fm support in & amarok;. Tracks played are submitted to the last. fm server, and if asked to, & amarok; will request recommendations based on your currently playing track.
last. fm Profile
This is where you fill in the Username and Password for your last. fm profile. If you do not have a profile you can register at the last. fm website.
last. fm Services
Improve my profile by submitting the tracks I play: allows & amarok; to submit your played tracks to your last. fm profile.
Retrieve similar artists: this will cause & amarok; to request, from last. fm, a list of artists similar to the one you're listening to. These are also displayed in the Context Browser. Note: you do not need a last. fm profile to receive similar artists - simply check this box.
Questions and Answers
What is & amarok;?
What is & amarok;?
& amarok; is a music player for Unix systems (eg. Linux). More information can be found in a summary of its features and the screenshot gallery.
Installation
Can I use & amarok; without KDE?
& amarok; only requires KDElibs, none of the other KDE stuff. So you have to have KDElibs installed properly (including all the binaries that come with it, as & amarok; needs some of these to find plugins and for the script plugins). We have written an entry for how to compile a minimal KDElibs, which you may find useful.
For some features to work correctly, such as the on-screen display, require your window manager to support the relevant freedesktop. org standards. So GNOME will work well, but fluxbox will have some trouble. We are committed to supporting & amarok; on all platforms. We use KDElibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.
Troubleshooting
& amarok; crashes during the Collection scan, always at the same point. What's happenning?
It's likely that one file in your Collection triggers a bug in the TagLib library, and makes & amarok; crash. You can identify this file by looking at ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ amarok/ collection_scan. log. You should report this crash to the TagLib bug database on bugs. kde. org and attach the broken file. Afterward you can remove the file from your Collection and repeat the scanning.
& amarok; crashes when I play a certain track, everytime, what's wrong?
This usually means TagLib is crashing while reading that track's tags. Report the bug against TagLib at bugs. kde. org.
& amarok; crashes often, what can I do?
Upgrade your ALSA libs and utils to the latest version, or use OSS, or OSS emulation.
Try a different audio-engine.
Make sure that all the libraries that & amarok; uses were compiled with the same GCC version as & amarok; itself. The situation when & amarok; is compiled using GCC 3.4. x and linked against taglib which was compiled using GCC 3.3. x can lead to crashes during tag editing.
Otherwise, forward us the backtraces when the email pops-up (you'll see). If you get a crash often you will get it fixed for sure if you forward a really good backtrace to us. See the next sections for assistance there.
How can I obtain a decent backtrace?
See the Debugging HowTo.
& amarok; is not displaying my utf-8 id3v2 tags properly!
This is because most applications put utf8 data into id3v2 tags but do not specify the encoding as unicode. This perl script will fix that.
#! /usr/ bin/ perl die "File $ARGV[0] does n't exist" unless -f $ARGV[0]; use MP3: :Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3: :Mplib- > new($ARGV[0]); my $v2tag = $mp3- > get_v2tag; print "Error writing tags of $ARGV[0]\" unless $mp3- > set_v2tag($v2tag, amp; UTF8);
This script requires the perl module MP3: :Mplib which can be installed by issuing this command perl -MCPAN -e'install MP3: :Mplib '
Why do my statusbar icons always look active?
& amarok; statusbar icons(Random/ Repeat/ Append) look constantly Active on KDE 3.4.0. This is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. The icon effects are sometimes forgotten. Simple fix kcontrol Appearance Icons Advanced, set disabled state to "Gray" and "Semi-transparent". Note that sometimes you must click on the icon 3 times before it has an effect after making this change.
Why does & amarok; complain about undefined symbols and then refuses to start?
if you get this error: "amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap", then check that amarokapp uses the correct libqt (check with: ldd ` which amarokapp ` _BAR_ grep qt).
To fix it, you might have to remove any conflicting libqt and/ or edit / etc/ ld. so. conf so it pick up the correct version first.
General Usage
Where can I get support for & amarok;?
There are several options. Often times problems you have with the initial install of & amarok; are best answered by experts of your particular Unix or Linux distribution. You may seek help from fellow users and developers at the amarok; forum and the IRC channel at irc. freenode. net channel #amarok.
Bugzilla is not a place to seek support. Please do enter a bug if you are serious about helping fix a bug in & amarok; itself.
When I start & amarok;, I see an empty playlist. How do I actually get tracks in there?
Where is the"Home "tab?
To avoid interface-clutter "Home" tab has been transformed into "Statistics" tool, available under Tools Statistics.
Yes, use the right mouse button menu anywhere on "Context" browser to modify it.
Why are the stars and numbers in the "Context" browser are out of sync?
The meaning of those symbols has changed in Amarok 1.4 "Fast Forward": stars represents the user-defined rating, while numbers shows calculated score.
Clicking on stars in "Context" browser does not work! How do I rate a song?
To rate a track you need a "Rating" column in playlist. Click with the & RMB; on playlist title, and choose Add Column Rating. Click anywhere inside "Rating" column to set up rating for a track. You can also use shortcuts [Win]+[1-5] to quickly rate a song, with Amarok running in the background.
How do I remove tracks from the Playlist?
Select the files you want to remove, and press Del key on your keyboard. Or right-click the selection and choose Remove Selected from pop up menu.
How can I load a playlist?
Just drag and drop the playlist file into the Playlist, like you would do with any other file. It's that simple!
How can I save the current playlist?
The Save playlist button is next to Add Media button in the Playlist Toolbar. Just click it!
There are no visualizations in the visualizations dialog.
You probably do n't have xmms-config installed, reconfigure and build after installing the appropriate xmms-devel package. You also may want to install the latest version of libvisual, which has some ultra fancy visualizations.
Where's the equalizer?
The Equalizer Window can be found in the right mouse button menu. You can also find it in the Menubar by selecting Tools Equalizer.
Playback
What media types does & amarok; support?
None. Yes, that's right! None! We have a backend independent approach, so the question you should be asking is "What media types does GStreamer/ xine/ aRts/ NMM/ MAS/ KDEmm support?" So as you can guess we pretty much support absolutely every audio format you can think of. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!
For more information, have a look at Audio Engine Comparison.
Why ca n't & amarok; play MP3s?
It can! Chances are you're using Fedora/ RedHat linux, they do n't ship with MP3 decoders by default (due to patenting issues). Solution: Alt-F2, gg: redhat mp3 kde, ENTER
& amarok; wo n't play MP3's under SUSE Linux 9.3, what could I do?
Open the "YaST Online Update" and install the'Multimedia Option Pack 1 'patch. Voila, & amarok; plays MP3's.
With GStreamer-engine I'm getting 100% CPU usage while playing. How can I fix it?
When using GStreamer-engine with alsasink, & amarok; requires the device to provide a mixer. Mixing allows multiple applications to access the device at the same time, and output sound simultaneously. This can either be achieved by using a soundcard with hardware-mixing (e. g. SBLive), or by using the "dmix" plugin for alsa, which provides software-mixing. See Setting up Dmix for ALSA.
After installation you need to specify "dmix" as the sound device in the engine settings dialog.
You need to test the sound frameworks at the commandline:
artsplay foobar. mp3 gst-launch filesrc location=/ home/ foo/ bar. mp3! spider! audioscale! audioconvert! alsasink xine-check
Can & amarok; output directly to OSS/ ALSA?
We already do! Do n't forget that the media must be decoded first! You ca n't just pipe an MP3 to ALSA, all you will get is white-noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people who want a low-overhead decoding solution, it reads the file, decodes it and pipes the PCM data to ALSA. Exactly like XMMS.
But! XMMS can output directly to ALSA!
But it decodes it first! GStreamer can output directly to ALSA too! So can xine!
The sound stutters, is there anything I can do to improve it?
You can either use the GStreamer engine (it's great!), or tweak aRts. Open Control Center Sound and Multimedia Sound System. Enable Run with highest possible priority, and increase the size of the Sound buffer: (warning, see the next FAQ!) You should also ensure that your artswrapper is suid:
su chmod a+rsx / path/ to/ kde/ bin/ artswrapper killall -9 artsd
With KDE 3.2. x there are issues with the KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause distorted playback, please see this bug report. Also, increasing the size of the sound buffer in your. asoundrc alsa configuration file can help a great deal.
Either do n't use the aRts-engine, use the GStreamer or xine engines, or address the high CPU usage by installing KDEMultimedia in its entirety to get the faster aRts codecs (eg. libarts_mpeglib. so, etc.)
The & amarok; analyzers are really unresponsive!
You are probably using the aRts-engine, either use another engine (the xine-engine has been seriously tweaked to give perfect analyzer-sync), or reduce the size of your aRts buffer in kcontrol, sound system. The lower the buffer the more responsive the visuals. Yes this is a bug, please help us fix it!
I have GStreamer installed but when I try to change to the GStreamer engine & amarok; crashes, what gives?
After installing GStreamer you have register it's components, running ` gst-register ` (sometimes suffixed with a version, so gst-register-0.8) should take care of registering your GStreamer components.
I ran gst-register but I still have have GStreamer troubles, what can I do?
You can try the GStreamer FAQ. If all else fails you can try the knowledgeable people at the #gstreamer IRC channel.
& amarok; says that the GStreamer engine cannot play MP3 files, although I have compiled/ installed the mad plugin!
Try this (make sure that & amarok; does not run): - Download, compile and install the ffmpeg package - Run gst-register (you may need to run it twice, as root and as your "normal" user) - Go to your GStreamer plugin directory (you can find it with gst-config / gstreamer-config) - Delete the ffmpeg files (or move them somewhere else) - Run gst-register again - Start & amarok;
Development
How do I get a cvs/ svn version of & amarok;?
How to obtain and build SVN & amarok;
I've found a bug / I've got a great idea for & amarok;!
Please report it at bugs. kde. org, if you have a list of suggestions/ wishes it may be best to send them to our mailing list: amarok-devel@lists. sourceforge. net
Do you accept patches?
Why did you choose the name & amarok;?
Is it & amarok;, AmaroK or Amarok?
It is & amarok;! Yes, we understand this is unconventional; -)
How do I use & amarok; as an alarm clock?
If you have a properly set up ssh environment, you can use that to get the information. The following command will return the Now Playing string. ssh -i ~/. ssh/ id_rsa yourip dcop --user yourusername amarok player nowPlaying
Make sure that you replace yourip with your IP and yourusername with your username. Also note that this expects your identification to be found in the ~/. ssh/ id_rsa file.
The & amarok; player analyzers can be detached from the Player Window. By pressing d on your keyboard the active analyzer will open in an independent, re-sizeable window.
Holding Control and clicking the right mouse button enqueues files in the order in which you clicked them. Pressing Enter after making a playlist search will play the first search item and will clear the search.
Where do I find the settings for & amarok;?
~/. kde/ share/ apps/ amarok ~/. kde/ share/ config/ amarokrc
How do I disable a browser section in & amarok;?
General Questions
How Do I use an external MySQL database with & amarok;?
My $HOME is located on NFS. After startup, & amarok; fails to build the Collection, printing many database errors to the console. What to do?
The internal SQLite database which & amarok; uses by default does not work on NFS. You must either link your ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ amarok directory to a local drive, or use the MySQL support.
How can I rip/ encode Audio-CDs with & amarok;?
Insert your CD, then click on "Play Audio CD" in the menu. The File-Browser will come up and show a tree with several folders. For normal ripping, go to the "wav" folder, select some tracks and drag them to the desired destination in a Konqueror window. For automatic encoding, drag files from the "mp3" or "ogg" folder instead.
CD-ripping requires the "AudioCD KIO-slave" to be installed. It is part of KDE-Multimedia.
How are track ratings determined?
Substituting in the values from this line:
QStringList values = query( QString( "SELECT playcounter, createdate, percentage FROM statistics" "WHERE url = '%1 ';"). arg( escapeString( url)));
We have score = ((statistics_percentage. toDouble() * PlayCounter. toInt()) + percentage) / (PlayCounter. toInt() + 1);
How do I manually change a track's rating?
You may change the rating manually by right-clicking on the playlist columns titles (the ones that say title, artist, album etc) and select Score. You can then change the score like any other song attribute, by right clicking it and selecting "Edit Tag'Score '" or pressing F2. You can also edit the score in the Tag dialog, available by right clicking on a track.
Why is n't & amarok; part of KDEmultimedia?
The developers do n't want the man telling them when they can release. (Meaning, packages in KDE proper have a release schedule that does n't fit with & amarok; 's fast-paced development).
This is a new feature that has been added that some users might find distracting. Simply uncheck the "Flash icon tray when playing" option under General Options.
The playlist analyzer is part of the playlist toolbar. Select Settings Configure Toolbars Add/ Remove Analyzer to the Current actions Press OK
How do I change the Context Browser theme?
Download a theme or make your own. Install it through Configure & amarok;... Appearance Context Browser Style, click Install New Style.
What legal issues caused "Blue Wolf" icon replacement?
The icon was way too similar to the Warp Graphics, Inc. logo (elfquest. com), so it had to be removed to avoid problems.
I do n't have any visualizations. Where can I obtain these?
Install the latest version of libvisual.
How can I add my favorite streams to & amarok;?

Audioscrobbler
What is Audioscrobbler?
I do not want & amarok; to send information to Audioscrobbler!
Uncheck "Submit tracks I play" to prevent querying Audioscrobbler for suggested tracks.
How do I get to the Audioscrobbler & amarok; group?
The Audioscrobbler & amarok; group is located here: amarok; Audioscrobbler Group
General Engine/ Playback Questions
Which sound engine should I use?
Please refer to the Audio Engine Comparison.
& amarok; was probably compiled before you had xine and/ or gstreamer installed, so the. / configure routine did not include them in the list of engines to be built. You will have to rebuild & amarok;.
But I did rebuild & amarok; after installing gstreamer and/ or xine, but the engine still does not show up. What happened?
You most likely are using a distro that packages development libraries separately from the main library, so even though gstreamer is installed, & amarok; cannot link to it because gstreamer-devel is not installed. The same issue exists for xine, you must install xine-devel if your distro splits packages in this fashion. Do n't forget to rebuild & amarok; after installing the devel packages.
GStreamer engine
Make sure you do n't have gst-ffmpeg installed. Instead, install the gst-mad plugin.
I'm getting this error: "GStreamer-CRITICAL **: Factory for ` adder 'has no type.". How to fix?
Your GStreamer was built with Prelinking, which is not compatible with GStreamer. You must rebuild it without this option. merlin-tc advises: In addition, do n't use any ldflags when building GStreamer.
You receive an error "There is no element present to handle the file's mimetype audio/ mp4" even though you have the correct gstreamer-faad plugin is installed.
To correctly play mp4 or m4a files with gstreamer, you must also have gstreamer-quicktime in addition to gstreamer-faad installed.
You are trying to play an mp3 stream without the gstreamer-mad plugin installed. Install the gstreamer-mad plugin and run "gst-register" as root before restarting & amarok;.
I have a second soundcard and I'm using ALSA. How do I make Amarok use it instead of the default?
In Settings Configure Amarok Engine, check the'Device 'checkbox and fill in the device. Typical this is'hw:0' for the default soundcard, and'hw:1 'for the second soundcard.
xine engine
Here is a sample ~/. asoundrc for a machine that has an onboard Intel AC97 codec and a usb-audio device:
pcm. intel8x0 {type plug slave. pcm "hw:0"} ctl. intel8x0 {type hw card 0} pcm. usb-audio {type plug slave. pcm "hw:1"} ctl. usb-audio {type hw card 1}
Now enter usb-audio in the xine-engine setup screen and output should go to the usb-audio device (with alsa-lib properly handling sample rate conversion, channels, and so on).
To use a dmixed virtual device, ensure that the "sound card can do mmap" checkbox is unchecked.
aRts engine
Sorry, aRts-engine has no maintainer, but feel free to fix it yourself! You could be the new aRts-engine maintainer we need so desperately!

Context Browser
The Context Browser displays various information related to the currently playing track. Its appearance can be modified by using themes known as Context Browser Styles. It is organized into three tabs: Music, Lyrics, and Artist. These tabs, whose function will be more fully explained below, supply information on different aspects the track currently being listened to.
Users of previous & amarok; versions will notice that there is no longer a Home tab. The information from this tab has been redistributed throughout the & amarok; interface. Analogous information can be found mainly in the Statistics dialog, accessible through Tools Statistics.
Context Screenshot
The Music tab offers information about the currently playing track, and it's artist and album.
The first pane in this tab is for information about the track. The title of the pane lists the track name, artist name, and album. Inside the pane you will find it shows the album cover image for the track. Next to the image you will find a MusicBrainz icon. Click this icon to do a MusicBrainz look-up for the track.
The next pane, Suggested Songs, lists multiple tracks for suggested listening. Click on any of the listed tracks to begin playback of the track.
Below Suggested Songs is the Favorite Tracks By Artist. This pane lists the five highest rated tracks by the current track's artist.

The Refresh button clears cached lyrics for current track, and searches again.
The Artist tab shows Wikipedia article about currently played artist. Toolbar contains:
Collection Browser
The Group By pull-down menu allows you to group your collection in several ways:
Group By Artist/ Year-Album - Sorts by artist, with albums in descending order of year (most recent first). If there is no Year tag set for a track, the default 0 - album name.
Group By Album - Every album in your collection is displayed alphabetically based on the album name, regardless of artist.
Group By Genre/ Artist - Tracks are grouped according to their genre tag, then by artist.
Group By Genre/ Artist/ Album - Same as above, only with tracks sorted by album, below each artist.
Immediately below the toolbar is a search filter, which behaves the same in both Flat and Tree views. See the Playlist section of the handbook for more details on searching techniques.
Below the Search Filter, another pull-down menu lets you see the most recently added tracks to your collection. Several time periods are available, ranging from the last 24 hours, to 1 year, or your entire collection.
Load - Clears the current playlist and adds selected track(s) as first track(s), in sort order.
Append to Playlist - Adds selected track(s) to end of current playlist. Double clicking on a single track in the collection also achieves the same result.
Save as Playlist - Save the selected tracks as a playlist. You'll be prompted for a name to save as.
Burn All Tracks By This Artist/ Burn To CD - Sends track(s) to & k3b; for burning as either a data or Audio CD. If & k3b; is not installed, this option is not selectable.
Fetch Cover Image - Searches amazon. com for a cover image for this album.
Manage Files

Playlist Browser
The bottom section of the Playlist Browser is the Smart Playlists. The Smart Playlists use & amarok; 's built in data base to compile some useful playlists on the fly. The Smart Playlists include the following:
All Collection: a playlist with all the tracks that are in your configured collection.
Favorite Tracks: multiple playlists of the fifteen highest rated tracks in a listview by artitst.
Most Played: multiple playlists of the fifteen most played tracks in a listview by artitst.
Newest Tracks: multiple playlists of the fifteen most recently added tracks in a listview by artitst.
Last Played: a playlist of the fifteen most recently played tracks in your collection.
Never Played: a playlist of the tracks in your collection which have never been played before.
Genres: multiple playlists in a listview ordered by genre.
User defined smart playlists are also possible. Clicking the Create Smart-Playlist button will open a dialog to configure a smart playlist to fit your criteria.
The Media Device panel is used for connecting your iPod, to & amarok;. To use your iPod with the Media Device browser you must have your iPod mounted at / mnt/ ipod before starting & amarok;. Once you have started & amarok; you will find the tracks on your iPod listed by artist in a listview at the top of the browser.
To add tracks to your iPod, drag the tracks you want to add from the playlist and drop them on the Artist listview. After you are done adding tracks to the list click the Transfer button to upload them to your iPod. After the transfer has completed, close & amarok; and unmount your iPod.
File Browser
At the bottom of the File Browser is an address bar for accessing your music from any URL that you type. For instance typing tar: / home/ mike/ music. tar. gz into the address bar and pressing & Enter; on your keyboard will allow you to access the files inside the music tar ball. Now you can drag the audio from the tar ball and drop it into the playlist.
The Playlist
Playlist Screenshot
Advanced, Google-esque syntax is also available.
By default, when you enter terms separated by spaces, it will search for items containing all of them. For example: one two three, will search for anything that contains one, two, and three.
However, you can put OR between terms to search for items that contain either, like this: one OR two OR three. That way, it will search for items that contain either one, or two, or three (or a combination of them).
You can also use quotes to search for terms with spaces in them: "Mike Oldfield". That will search for items that contain Mike Oldfield, but not, for example, ones that contain Mike J. Oldfield.
To specify a term you do n't want the items to match, you can put a minus (-) sign before them: -thing, to search for anything that does n't contain thing.
You can combine the above at will, for example: "Mike Oldfield" OR score: > 50 -comment: bad. That will search for anything that either contains Mike Oldfield or has a score greater than 50, but excludes items where the comment contains "bad".

Installation
The main information site for & k3b; is www. k3b. org. For the most current version of & k3b;, feedback and community help as well as & k3b; news and other information, this is the place to go.
Requirements
In order to successfully use & k3b;, you need & kde; & gt; = 3.1 and & Qt; & gt; = 3.1.
& cdrdao;: Records audio or data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based on a textual description of the CD contents (toc-file).
& cdrecord; /mkisofs;: Records any kind of CD-Rs. & cdrecord; contains all of & cdrdao; 's features and extended functionality and therefore is & k3b; 's standard choice for CD burning. In some cases, & cdrdao; reaches better audio CD burning quality though.
& dvdtools;: The & dvdtools; are used to burn and format DVD+R(W) and DVD-R(W) media.
Optionally & k3b; can make use of all these libraries:
cdparanoia: A Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, commonly known on the net as a'ripper '.
Ogg Vorbis library: Ogg Vorbis is a completely open, patent-free, professional audio encoding and streaming technology with all the benefits of Open Source, and in direct competition with the MP3 format. Used by the Ogg Vorbis Decoder and Encoder plugins.
MAD (MPEG Audio Decoder) Library: A high-quality MPEG audio decoder, supporting the MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG 2.5 formats. All three audio layers Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (i. e. MP3) are fully implemented. Used by the MP3 Decoder plugin.
LAME: A highly evolved MP3 encoder, with quality and speed able to rival state of the art commercial encoders. Used by the MP3 Encoder plugin.
FLAC: A free, open source codec for lossless audio compression and decompression. Used by the FLAC Decoder plugin and the External Audio Encoder plugin, so you can read and write FLAC files.
Libsndfile, FFmpeg, FLAC, Musepack decoders: Other libraries for processing a broad range of audio file formats. For example, with FFmpeg it is possible to decode WMA files in order to burn them onto audio CDs. Used by the respective plugins.
SoX: A utility that can convert between various audio file formats. Used by the SoX Audio Encoder plugin.
transcode: A Linux text-console utility for video stream processing. You need this if you want to rip DVD video.
VCDImager: A full-featured mastering suite for authoring, disassembling and analyzing Video CDs and Super Video CDs.
Normalize: A tool for adjusting the volume of audio files to a standard level. This is useful for things like creating mixed CDs and MP3 collections, where different recording levels on different albums can cause the volume to vary greatly from song to song.
eMovix: A tiny Linux distribution that is burned on CD together with video files. eMovix contains all the software to boot from a CD and automatically play every video file localized in the CD root.

The & k3b; & DCOP; Interface
This chapter assumes that you're using the dcop commandline program. To access & k3b; 's & DCOP; functions, make sure that & k3b; is started and then enter something like this at a console:
# dcop k3b K3bInterface [function]
Besides the generic & DCOP; functions available to all & kde; applications, & k3b; 's DCOP interface mainly consists of two parts as described below.
The default K3bInterface
The default K3b DCOP interface provides functionality like copyCD, formatDVD, and methods for creating new projects.
DCOPRef createDataCDProject() DCOPRef createAudioCDProject() DCOPRef createMixedCDProject() DCOPRef createVideoCDProject() DCOPRef createMovixCDProject() DCOPRef createDataDVDProject() DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject() DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject() DCOPRef openProject(KURL url) QValueListlt; DCOPRefgt; projects() DCOPRef currentProject() void copyCd() void copyDvd() void eraseCdrw() void formatDvd() void burnCdImage(KURL url) void burnDvdImage(KURL url)
As result from one of the createXXXProject methods one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef(k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you may create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then retrieve a reference to this project with # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject Using this reference it is possible to manipulate the project using the K3bProjectInterface.
K3bProjectInterface
void addUrls(KURL: :List urls) void addUrl(KURL url) void burn()
K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface as listed above or the more powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which only applies to data projects (CD and DVD):
void createFolder(QString name) void createFolder(QString name, QString parent) void addUrl(KURL url, QString parent) void addUrls(KURL: :List urls, QString parent) void removeItem(QString path) void renameItem(QString path, QString newName) void setVolumeID(QString id)
#! /bin/ bash PROJECT=$(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home/ trueg/ somefile. txt / foo/ bar

The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs smbstatus and showmount. Smbstatus reports on current Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager protocol.
showmount is part of the NFS software package. NFS stands for Network File System and is the traditional & UNIX; way to share folders over the network. In this case the output of showmount -a localhost is parsed. On some systems showmount is in / usr/ sbin, check if you have showmount in your PATH.

& konqueror; Basics
Like all & kde; applications, & konqueror; is highly configurable. This document describes how & konqueror; behaves with the normal, default settings.
Starting & konqueror;
If you have a house shaped icon on the panel or desktop, then left click on it to open & konqueror; as a file manager.
Or left click on world shaped icon on the panel or desktop to open & konqueror; in browser mode.
From the K menu, select Internet Konqueror Web Browser to start it as a browser, or Home to launch & konqueror; in file manager mode.
Alt; F2 will open a Run Command dialog box, type konqueror (lower case) and press Enter or the Run button to start in file manager mode, or just enter a & URL; such as http: / /www. konqueror. org to start & konqueror; as a browser.
A brief look at the main parts of & konqueror; 's window:
The Menubar is the strip containing the names of the drop-down menus. Left click on a name to alternately show and hide that menu, or use Alt; the underlined letter in the name as a hot key, for example Alt; E to show the Edit menu. The various menus are described in the Menubar section of this document.
Right clicking on the Toolbar will bring up the Toolbar Menu which you can use to change the Toolbar's appearance and position.
The Location Toolbar shows the path to the directory, & URL; or file being viewed. You can type a path or & URL; here and press & Enter; or left click on the Go icon at the right hand end of the Location Toolbar to go to it. The black icon at the left hand end of the Location Toolbar clears the text entry box.
The Bookmark Toolbar is the area under the Location Toolbar in the previous screenshot. You can add frequently used bookmarks here; see the Organizing Your Bookmarks section of this document.
Do n't worry if your & konqueror; does n't look exactly like this screenshot; it is highly configurable. In particular:
This screenshot does not show the optional Navigation Panel.
Tooltips and What's This?
You can find out a lot about how & konqueror; works without needing to read this entire document if you take advantage of Tooltips and the What's This? feature.
What's This? is invoked by the Menubar Help What's This? item, by Shift; F1, or by just & LMB; clicking on the question mark near the top right hand corner of & konqueror; 's window. It changes the cursor to show a question mark alongside the arrow.
Left and Middle Mouse Button Actions
Left click on an item in the Menubar to make that menu drop down.
Left click on a menu item to do that thing.
Left click on an icon in the Bookmark Toolbar to open that & URL;.
Left click on a link in a web page to make & konqueror; follow that link.
Left click on a folder icon or name and & konqueror; will descend into (show the contents of) that folder.
Left click on a file name or icon and & konqueror; will do whatever it thinks appropriate, based on the file type. In general this means opening HTML pages, or previewing text, image or KOffice files, showing them within & konqueror; 's window (Preview means that you can see the file but not change it).
Holding the & Shift; key down while pressing the & MMB; will open the link in the background.
Right Mouse Button Menus
Right click in the & URL; entry box area to perform Cut, Copy, Paste or Clear operations in this area, or to change the automatic Text Completion features.
If you right click on any free area of a view then you will get a menu that contains, among other options, the Up, Back, Forward and Reload navigation commands.
Viewing Help, Man and Info Pages
You can view & kde; Help and & UNIX; Man and Info pages directly in & konqueror;, without having to start up KHelpCenter.
To view a & kde; Help page, enter help: / application name (for example help: / kmail to view the & kmail; documentation.) into & konqueror; 's Location Toolbar window.
If you want to read & UNIX; Man pages & konqueror; makes it easy. For example type man: / touch or #touch into the Location Toolbar to see the page for the touch command.
To browse through & UNIX; Info pages, entering info: / dir takes you to Info's top level directory, then it's just a matter of clicking on the right links to find the page you want. Alternatively, use info: / command name to go straight to the Info page you want.
Unfortunately, & kde; Help pages are stored in such a way that they cannot be viewed in other browsers. If you really need to do this your only recourse is to go online and visit http: / /docs. kde. org.
& Pamela. Roberts;
Using Bookmarks
To open the Bookmarks menu you may either left click on the Bookmarks menu or use the Alt; B shortcut. Once the list is visible, you can navigate through it with the arrow keys or with your mouse, then press & Enter; or left click to visit the selected location.
You can also access your bookmarks from the Navigation Panel.
The Bookmarks Edit Bookmarks option opens the Bookmark Editor.
To change the name of a bookmark or folder select it then press F2 or choose the Rename item from the Edit menu or the pop up menu that appears when you right click on the item. Similarly, you can edit the & URL; by pressing F3 or choosing the Change URL menu item.
The Bookmark Editor lets you import bookmarks from a range of other browsers into & konqueror; 's bookmark list, putting them into a new folder or replacing all current bookmarks. To do this select Import from the File menu. The File Export option can be used to export & konqueror; 's bookmarks to a & Netscape; or Mozilla browser.
If you often use the & Netscape; browser as well as & konqueror;, then rather than importing your & Netscape; bookmarks into & konqueror; it is better to select the Show Netscape Bookmarks in Konqueror Windows item in the Settings menu. If you do this any updates to & Netscape; 's bookmarks are automatically seen by & konqueror;.
Do n't forget to save your changes with File Save or Ctrl; S before you leave the Bookmark Editor.
& Pamela. Roberts;

into the Location Toolbar and press & Enter;. As long as you are connected to the Internet, and as long as the & kde; 's & FTP; site is not too busy, you should end up seeing the / pub/ kde folder at & kde-ftp;
Although, strictly speaking, & FTP; & URL; s should be entered starting with ftp: / / and WWW & URL; s starting with http: / / & konqueror; is usually smart enough to figure out what is meant, and insert these characters for you if you leave them out.
ftp: / / username @ftp. cia. org
& konqueror; will then prompt you for the password.
& konqueror; can also support automatic logins as specified in a. netrc file. Details of how to enable this feature are given at http: / /www. konqueror. org/ faq. html#netrc
If you specify a port number in your & URL;, as in for example http: / /intranet. corp. com:1080, you might get the error message Access to restricted port in POST denied. This is done for security reasons. If you nevertheless need to access a server on this port, just add a key line OverridenPorts=CommaSeparatedListOfAllowedPorts to $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kio_httprc or ~/. kde/ share/ config/ kio_httprc.
For example OverridenPorts=23,15 (it should not include any embedded spaces).
& konqueror; will reject the following ports (the list is hardcoded in kdelibs/ kio/ kio/ job. cpp):
1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 37, 42, 43, 53, 77, 79, 87, 95, 101, 102, 103, 104, 109, 110, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 123, 135, 139, 143, 179, 389, 512, 513, 514, 515, 526, 530, 531, 532, 540, 556, 587, 601, 989, 990, 992, 993, 995, 1080, 2049, 4045, 6000, 6667

Questions and Answers
Can I run & konqueror; from another window manager?
Just install & Qt;, kdelibs and kdebase, and from your favorite window manager, launch & konqueror;. It should work just fine, but if it does n't (kde; developers do n't test that case often), report it to http: / /bugs. kde. org and try running kdeinit before running & konqueror;; it usually helps.
Where does & konqueror; keep all its configuration data?
Generally in the ~/. kde folder (this may be ~/. kde3 on your system, depending on how & kde; 3 was installed). Do n't alter these files unless you really know what you are doing.
The ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ profiles folder holds individual files containing settings for each of your profiles.
Your bookmarks are held in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ bookmarks. xml
Cookies are held in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kcookiejar/ cookies
Your history, as used for the auto-completion feature, is in ~/. kde/ share/ config/ konq_history
In the folder ~/. kde/ share/ config/ the files konqiconviewrc, konqlistviewrc and konquerorrc hold a whole lot of general configuration settings.
The folder ~/. kde/ share/ cache/ http/ contains the browser cache.
The Navigation Panel uses the files and subfolders in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqsidebartng
Any folder specific view settings are put into. directory files in the individual folders.
There are two histories:
One is used for text completion in the Location Toolbar text entry box. To clear this right click on the text entry box and select Clear History.
The other is the log of visited locations. Select the History page in the Navigation Panel, right click on an entry and choose Remove Entry to remove just that entry or Clear History to delete all entries.
How do I enable, disable or clear the browser cache?
In the Control Center Internet & Network Preferences page.
Start & konqueror; with the Web Browser icon on the panel. Open the page you want to be loaded in any new Web Browser window and select Save View Profile "Web Browsing" from the Settings menu.
This does not change the behavior of the Home button on the & konqueror; toolbar, which will continue to take you to the & URI; defined in the & konqueror; configuration module. You can reach that module from within & konqueror;, via Settings Configure Konqueror Behavior. By default this is set to ~, which is your Home folder. You may set this to any & URI;, either local or remote, and pressing the Home icon on the toolbar will display it.
To have & konqueror; start up with no page loaded, use about: blank.
I ca n't find the answer to my question here.
Take a look at http: / /www. konqueror. org/ faq. html or http: / /www. konqueror. org/ konq-java. html.
& Pamela. Roberts;
Folders and Paths
Every user on a & UNIX; / & Linux; system has their own home folder to hold their personal files and settings; for example / home/ john and / home/ mary. The symbol ~ is often used to represent the user's home folder, so that ~/ letter. txt refers to the file letter. txt in my home folder.
Note that the term directory is often used instead of folder.
View Modes
Icon View
MultiColumn View
Tree View
In addition to the file name, some file detail information is shown on each line. The details are controlled by the View Show Details sub menu settings.
Text View
File Previews
Navigation
To descend into a subfolder left click on its name or icon -- or if you have already selected it (see below) -- then just press Enter.
To go up the folder tree you can click on the Up button in the Toolbar, use Alt; Up Arrow, or use the Menubar Go Up option.
You can go directly to any folder by typing its path into the Location Toolbar window or into the dialog box invoked by the Menubar Location Open Location item or by Ctrl; O. & konqueror; 's Text Completion feature may be useful when you do this. Do n't forget that in & Linux; / & UNIX; file and folder names are case sensitive.
When you have moved to a new folder you can go back to your previous choice by using the Toolbar Back button, the Menubar Go Back item, or Alt; Left Arrow. Once you have gone back you can go forward. Use the Toolbar Forward button, the Menubar Go Forward item or Alt; Right Arrow.
Alternatively, you can also choose to enter the parent folder by clicking on the Toolbar Up, the Go Up item, or with Alt; Up Arrow.
Finding Files and Folders
If you do n't know or ca n't remember where a file or folder is within your system, then use the Toolbar Find File button or the Menubar Tools Find File... option. This will embed the file finder application & kfind; into & konqueror; 's window. See the & kfind; Handbook for help in using & kfind;.
If the name of a file or folder begins with a period (dot), then it is a hidden file or folder, and will not normally be shown by & konqueror;. To see hidden files or folders use the Menubar View Show Hidden Files option.
Any floppy disk, & CD; drive or other hard disk partition that you have on your system will usually appear in the /, / media, / mnt or / auto folder, having a path something like / mnt/ floppy or / cdrom. The details will depend on how your system was set up.
How you do this will depend on how your system:
You may have Floppy, & CD-ROM; and hard disk icons on your desktop, in which case & LMB; click on the icon to mount it. Doing this should also bring up a & konqueror; window showing the contents of the floppy, & CD-ROM; or partition. To unmount, right click on the icon and choose the Unmount item. Visit the section Create New... in this Handbook to see how to create such an icon.
mount / mnt/ floppy
to mount, for example, the floppy drive, and
umount / mnt/ floppy
to unmount it (umount not unmount).
Rather than having to open a text console to type the mount or umount commands, you may prefer to use & konqueror; 's Tools Execute Shell Command (Ctrl; E) feature.
Deleting Files and Folders
& konqueror; gives you two ways to dispose of an unwanted file or folder:
Or, if you have selected the item, the Menubar Edit menu will give you the choice of Move to Trash and Delete options.
Del will move the selected item or items to Trash.
Shift; Del will really, truly and irrevocably delete the selected item or items.
Moving and Copying
To copy a file or subfolder between folders you can:
Or if the item is selected you can use the Copy button on the Toolbar or the Menubar Edit Copy item, or the Ctrl; C shortcut key combination. You can also select multiple files or folders to copy/ move as well.
Using Drag'n Drop
& konqueror; also supports Drag and Drop copying and moving of files and folders.
This screenshot illustrates the use of the Menubar Window Split View Left/ Right option, also available with the shortcut Ctrl; Shift; L, to split the main & konqueror; window into two views, each showing the contents of a different folder.
Overwrite the old file with the newly copied one. The Overwrite All button can be used if you have copied multiple items.
Cancel the paste operation by pressing the Skip or Skip All button.
Give the file that is being copied a different name. You can do this by typing a new name into the text entry box or get & konqueror; to Propose one. When you have done this press the Rename button.
Use the Menubar Edit Selection Select... item or the shortcut Ctrl; +. This brings up a little dialog box in which you enter a filename containing the wildcard characters *, which matches any number of characters, and? which matches a single character. Press OK and & konqueror; will highlight all files with matching names. For example;
flag*. png will select all filenames starting with the letters flag and ending with. png.
memo?. txt will select memo1. txt and memo9. txt but not memo99. txt.
Use Ctrl; U or the Menubar Edit Unselect All option or just & LMB; click on a clear area of the view to cancel the selection.
You can even invert the selection: that is, deselect all selected files and select those that were previously unselected. Use the Menubar Edit Invert Selection option or Ctrl; * to do this.
Space
Toggle the current selection.
Insert
Toggle the current selection and move down to the next item.
Ctrl; Up Arrow, Ctrl; Down Arrow, Ctrl; Home, Ctrl; End, Ctrl; Page Up, Ctrl; Page Down
Move the selection, toggling the selection of everything on the way.
Shift; Up Arrow, Shift; Down Arrow, Shift; Home, Shift; End, Shift; Page Up, Shift; Page Down
Deselect everything, then move the selection, selecting everything on the way.
Depending on your keyboard type and locale, you may find that the Ctrl; +, Ctrl; - and Ctrl; * shortcuts only work with the Numeric keypad +, - and * keys.

Changing Names and Permissions
Permissions, which shows you the item's ownership and access permissions and lets you change the permissions.
Copy and Rename
Take care. As Super User (root), you have complete control of your system, and a wrong command can easily do irrevocable damage.
You can, of course, open an instance of & konsole;, perhaps with & konqueror; 's Menubar Tools Open Terminal option or with Ctrl; T.
If you only want to launch a program or view a & URL;, the Tools Run Command (Alt; F2) option may be easier.
Tools Execute Shell Command... (Ctrl; E) opens a small command line dialog window where you can enter a shell command such as ps -ax _BAR_ grep kdeinit. Note that it does not support full featured terminal control characters, so applications such as top and less will not work properly, but it is available immediately without the delay involved in starting & konsole;.

Overview
konqueror; is also an excellent full featured FTP client.
konqueror; is a universal viewing application, capable of displaying images and documents without having to launch another application. It does this by embedding components (kde; Parts) provided by other applications; from & kview; for image viewing, & kdvi; for DVI viewing, & kghostview; for & PostScript; documents and from the various & koffice; applications for their document types.

For those with a deep interest in the taxonomy of free X terminals, there are two others of this kind: xterm, the original, written even before X itself (a month or two), and xvt, a lightweight xterm clone, on which most other currently available derivatives (notably eterm) are based.

KDE
KWrite
text
editor
Introduction
Some Fundamentals
& kwrite; is very simple to use. Anyone that has used a text editor should have no problems.
Drag and Drop
& kwrite; uses the & kde; Drag and Drop protocol. Files may be dragged and dropped onto & kwrite; from the Desktop, the filemanager & dolphin;, or some remote & FTP; site opened in one of & dolphin; 's windows.
By specifying the path and name of a particular file the user can have & kwrite; open (or create) that file immediately upon startup. This option might look something like the following:
% kwrite / home/ myhome/ docs/ myfile. txt
% kwrite ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ README
kwrite --help
kwrite --help-qt
This lists the options available for changing the way & kwrite; interacts with & Qt;.
kwrite --help-kde
This lists the options available for changing the way & kwrite; interacts with & kde;.
kwrite --help-all
This lists all of the command line options.
kwrite --author
kwrite -v, --version
Lists version information for & Qt;, & kde;, and & kwrite;. Also available through kwrite -v
kwrite; --license
kwrite --stdin
Causes & kwrite; to read the document content from STDIN. This is similar to the common option - used in many command line programs, and allows you to pipe command output into & kwrite;.
kwrite --encoding encoding URL;
Causes & kwrite; to use the specified encoding for the document.
kwrite --line line URL;
Navigate to the specified line after opening the document.
kwrite --column column URL;
Navigate to the specified column after opening the document.
Shortcuts
Many of the shortcuts are configurable by way of the Settings menu. By default & kwrite; honors the following shortcuts:

Configuring & kde;
How do I set the language used by & kde;?
There are two ways to set the language & kde; uses in the messages it will display:
Using the kde; Control Center
Fire up the kde; Control Center and select Regional & Accessibility followed by Country/ Region & Language. You can select your language and location here. If & kde; cannot find a translation in the first language chosen, it will fall back on the default language. This is usually (American) English by default.
Yes, you can configure it using the kde; Control Center Regional & Accessibility Keyboard Layout configuration page.
First, you need to change to the xdm runlevel (runlevel 5 on & RedHat; and & SuSE; systems) by editing your / etc/ inittab file. In the file, you should have a line saying id:3: initdefault:. Change it to id:5: initdefault:. Now, at the end of the file, comment out the following line: x:5: respawn: / usr/ bin/ X11/ xdm -nodaemon and replace it with x:5: respawn: / opt/ kde/ bin/ kdm -nodaemon.
For FreeBSD, you should edit the file / etc/ ttys and change one of the lines that look like ttyv8 "/ usr/ X11R6/ bin/ xdm -nodaemon" xterm off secure to instead say ttyv8 "/ usr/ local/ bin/ kdm -nodaemon" xterm off secure.
If you are using & konqueror;, do this instead: first, open a & konqueror; window and choose Settings Configure Konqueror, then File Associations. Find the type you want to change (eg; text/ english or image/ gif), and set the application preference order to whatever you want.
& kde; (kdm;) does not read my. bash_profile!
The login managers xdm and & kdm; do not run a login shell, so. profile,. bash_profile, & etc; are not sourced. When the user logs in, xdm runs Xstartup as root and then Xsession as user. So the normal practice is to add statements in Xsession to source the user profile. Please edit your Xsession and. xsession files.
How do I use & TrueType; fonts in & kde;?
You need to install & TrueType; font support into your & X-Window; configuration. Please take a look at x. themes. org for the fonts, and xfsft: & TrueType; Font Support For X11 or X-TrueType; Server Project Home Page for the font servers.
Yes and no. For details, look here: http: / /www. koffice. org/ kword/ euro. php.
How do I run a program at & kde; startup?
Open & konqueror;.
Select Go Autostart from the menubar.
Open the kde; Control Center and choose Desktop Behavior. You can now choose the behavior of mouse clicks on the desktop. To have the K menu open from a single & LMB; click, change the entry labeled Left button to say Application Menu.
Contributing
How can I contribute to & kde;?
Send in bug reports. For more information on this, see How do I submit a bug report?.
Write documentation or help files. You can get some information by visiting the kde; Editorial Team Home Page.
Program new & kde; applications. Please refer to for more information.
Of course, sponsors are also welcome.: -)
I want to program for & kde;. What should I do first?
To get into & kde; programming, you will need some basic tools: cmake, and gcc. You should look to http: / /techbase. kde. org/ for more tips.
How do I get access to & kde; SVN?
Yes. Instructions on how to get anonymous, read-only SVN access are here: http: / /techbase. kde. org/ Getting_Started/ Sources/ Anonymous_SVN
Are there any SVN mirror sites for & kde;?
No, there are currently no anonymous SVN mirror sites for & kde;. If you're interested in setting one up, please contact sysadmin@kde. org
The desktop
How do I mount/ unmount a device from the desktop?
First, make sure you are allowed to mount / umount the relevant device as a user.
Where are the icons kept?
The icons can be found only in $KDEDIRS / share/ icons or $HOME /. kde/ share/ icons. To use icons stored in other locations, you must either copy them into one of the above-mentioned fixed & kde; locations or make symlinks.
How do I use the mouse scroll wheel in & kde;?
& kde; comes with a program called & kstart;. To start an xterm on the second desktop and then activate it use: kstart --desktop 2 --activate --window "xterm" xterm.
Please read kstart --help-all for more magic available with & kstart; (and there is an abundance).
& kde; 's file manager is & konqueror;. The & konqueror; home page is located at http: / /www. konqueror. org where a & konqueror; specific FAQ can be found.
Normally, if you enter a & URL; like ftp: / / ftp. example. com, & konqueror; will attempt an anonymous login to the & FTP; server. If you want to login as a particular user, enter a & URL; like ftp: / / username@ftp. example. com instead. & konqueror; will ask for your password and connect to the server.
You need to make sure that the embedding settings for inode/ directory are correct:
In & konqueror;, go to Settings Configure Konqueror and then to the File Associations page.
Open inode- > directory in the tree view.
What are %i and %m in the Execute line?
The easiest way to do this is to edit & konqueror; 's configuration file manually. Add the following lines to ~/. kde/ share/ config/ konquerorrc:
[KonqMainWindow] MenuBar=Disabled
On restarting & konqueror;, the menubar should be hidden.
Getting & kde;
Where do I get & kde;?
Currently, the latest stable version is 4.2.1
The kde; 4.2.1 Info Page contains a lot of information specific to this release.
Where do I get & Qt;?
& Qt; is a product of the Norwegian company Trolltech. You can always get the latest & Qt; version from their FTP; server.
And with most up-to-date & Linux; distributions, & Qt; is already included. Please see for the version of & Qt; you need.

The Debian packages install in accordance with the upcoming FHS (File Hierarchy Standard).
become superuser
run dpkg -i packagename. deb for every package you want to install.
To install binary RPM s
execute rpm -ivh packagename. rpm
The source. tar. bz2 package installs into / usr/ local/ kde by default. You can override this setting by using the --prefix option of the configure script.
unpack the packages with tar jxvf packagename. tar. bz2
change folder to the package folder: cd packagename
configure the package:. / configure
Some packages (notably kdebase) have special configuration options that might be applicable to your installation. Type. / configure --help to see the available options.
build the package: make
install the package: su -c "make install" (if you are n't already root). If you already are, just type make install.
Post-installation procedures
Please bear in mind that it is unwise to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH blindly. In the vast majority of cases it is unnecessary and can do more harm than good. There is a web page written by Dave Barr explaining the evils of LD_LIBRARY_PATH and it can be found at http: / /www. visi. com/ ~barr/ ldpath. html.
Some systems (notably & RedHat; & Linux;) use. Xclients instead.
In principle, this is not necessary. RPM and Debian packages should take care of all dependencies.
How do I start & kde;?
Source packages
Configure and install the package using configure --prefix= / users/ myhome/ kde; make; make install to install into / users/ myhome/ kde.

setenv KDEDIR / users/ myhome/ kde if ($? LD_LIBRARY_PATH) then setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $KDEDIR/ lib: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH else setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $KDEDIR/ lib endif if (! $? LIBRARY_PATH) then setenv LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH endif
KDEDIR=/ users/ myhome/ kde PATH=$KDEDIR/ bin: $PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/ lib: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH export KDEDIR PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH LIBRARY_PATH
RPM packages
rpm allows you to use the --prefix option to select the folder you want to install to. For example, executing rpm -i --prefix= / users/ myhome/ kde package. rpm will install the package to / users/ myhome/ kde.
startkde fails with can not connect to X server. What is wrong?
You probably tried to start the X server with startkde. The X server is started with startx. startkde is the script that should be run from your. xinitrc,. xsession, or. Xclients to activate the window manager and the necessary server daemons for & kde;. See also.

Introduction
What is & kde;?
& kde; is the K Desktop Environment. It is a project initiated by Matthias Ettrich in 1996. The aim of the & kde; project is to connect the power of the & UNIX; operating systems with the comfort of a modern user interface.
In short, & kde; will bring & UNIX; to the desktop!
If you want further information about & kde;, have a look at What is & kde;?
On which platforms can I expect & kde; to work?
Is & kde; a window manager?
No, & kde; is not a window manager. While & kde; includes a very sophisticated window manager (kwin;), & kde; is much more than that. It is a full-blown Integrated Desktop Environment.
Is & kde; a CDE, & Windows; or & Mac; OS clone?
No, & kde; is not a clone. Specifically & kde; is not a CDE or & Windows; clone. While the & kde; developers have and will continue to glean the best features from all existing desktop environments, & kde; is a truly unique environment that has and will continue to go its own way.
Is & kde; free software?
Yes, & kde; is free software according to the & GNU; General Public License. All & kde; libraries are available under the LGPL making commercial software development for the & kde; desktop possible, but all & kde; applications are licensed under the GPL.
& kde; uses the Qt; C++ crossplatform toolkit, which is also released (since version 2.2) under the GPL and since version 4.5.0 also under the LGPL.
It is absolutely legal to make & kde; and & Qt; available on & CD-ROM; free of charge. No runtime fees of any kind are incurred.
& kde; applications
& kppp;
Can you dialup to your ISP without using & kppp;? If you cannot, then perhaps & kppp; is not the culprit after all.
The & kppp; documentation can be accessed through the kde; Help Center. Last, but not least, the & kppp; homepage is at http: / /ktown. kde. org/ ~kppp/.
Open up the & kppp; dialog box and select Setup. Choose an existing account and click Edit, or New to create a new dialup account. Select the Dial tab and click Arguments. Type what you want to change in the Argument textbox (eg; mtu 296) and click Add. When you are satisfied, click Close.
In a terminal window, run / sbin/ ifconfig ppp0 and look at the reported & MTU; in the output. It should match your request.
Add debug and kdebug (each on a separate line) to your / etc/ ppp/ options file and restart your & PPP; session. You will find debugging messages in / var/ log/ messages, including & MRU; and & MTU; settings.
Try executing setserial spd_hi.
Check in your $HOME /. kde/ share/ config for the kppprc. Ensure the correct modem speed is actually defined there.
& konsole;
Use & Shift; Page Up and Shift; Pg Dn.
& kmail;
& kmail; has its own home page at http: / /kmail. kde. org where a FAQ is available.
Miscellaneous questions
Use & kmenuedit;. To access it use the & RMB; on the K button and select Menu Editor.
Does & kde; have a graphical & FTP; client?
How do I exit & kde;?
How do I copy and paste in & kde;?
Click on the K button and select System Appfinder.
What is SVN?
Does & kde; support dual screen (Xinerama)?
Yes, you need to have a multi-headed X server (eg; MetroX or XFree86 4.0 and above) and a & kde; > = 2.2.1
Go see http: / /kde-artists. org. There is also a more informal community of & kde; related artists and artwork at http: / /kde-look. org.
Where is the & kde; homepage?
The & kde; homepage is located at http: / /www. kde. org. If you prefer a local mirror, there are several to choose from. For a current list of web site mirrors sorted by location, please visit http: / /www. kde. org/ mirrors/ web. php.

Is there a newsgroup about & kde;?
Are there any other & kde; -related & FAQ; s?
Yes. Here is a list of them:
& kde; & FAQ;
& konqueror; & FAQ;
aRts sound server documentation
& kde; with non-kde; applications
My non-kde; applications like & Emacs; and kterm are running amok with strange colors!
Start the kde; Control Center and in Appearance & Themes Colors uncheck the Apply colors to non-KDE applications checkbox and click Apply.
If you are using & kde; 3.3 or later, open up the & kcontrolcenter; and navigate to the KDE Components Component Chooser panel. Select Web Browser from the list on the left, then select Open http and https URLs in the following browser: and type in the name of the browser (eg; mozilla, firefox, opera, & etc;) in the textbox.
Not really & kde; -related, but frequently asked nevertheless.
How do I change the screen resolution?
These instructions are only valid if you are running version 3.3. x of the XFree86 server. If you are running XFree86 4. x, you must consult with the XFree86(TM): Home Page.
There is no way you can do this on the fly. You can either start & X-Window; using startx -bpp number where number can be 8, 16, 24 or 32, depending on the depth you want. Alternatively, if you are using xdm / kdm;, you need to edit / etc/ X11/ xdm/ Xservers (may vary) and enter :0 local / usr/ X11R6/ bin/ X -bpp 16 for 16 bit color depth.
What is a "sticky" window?
How do I extract/ install diff files?
To generate a context-diff suitable for patching, use diff -u old-file new-file & gt; patchfile. To apply the diff to a file (i. e. "patch the file"), execute patch & lt; patchfile.
Just specify the filesystem type as auto in / etc/ fstab. Auto detection works fine for DOS and ext2.
How do I start & kde; with the Num Lock on?
Use & ksnapshot;.
What do all those acronyms like AFAIK mean?
The panel
In & kde; 3.2 and later local modifications to the & kmenu; are stored in $HOME /. config/ menus/ applications-kmenuedit. menu. Try moving this file out of the way and then issuing the command kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental. This should restore you to the default system menus.
Use ksystraycmd. For example, to start a & konsole; hidden in the system tray, run ksystraycmd --hidden konsole. For more information about ksystraycmd, see the section Advanced Window Management in the & kde; User Guide.
Find the keycode for your Win key using xev: Run the command xev in a & konsole;, and press the Win key. Look in the output of xev for keycode n, where n is the keycode of the Win key.
Use xmodmap to remap the Win key. An appropriate command is xmodmap -e'keycode n =Menu '.
& Qt; and Licensing questions
Why does & kde; use & Qt;?
Why does & kde; not use GTK, XForms, Xlib, whatever?
But & Qt; is n't free, is it?
Can I write commercial software for & kde;?
If you want more information, please contact Qt Software directly.
Asking Questions
What do I do before I ask?
Where do I ask?
Q: & kde; sucks, it's being slow
What do I do when told to look elsewhere?
How can I troubleshoot sound related problems in & kde;?
Try playing sound with artsplay / path/ to/ some/ soundfile. Try various formats, ogg, mp3 and wav. Any error messages there might be useful in pointing you in the right direction.
Try setting the & arts; output method to OSS. In the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia Sound System. On the Hardware tab, under Select the audio device choose Open Sound System. If you are running alsa this will use the OSS emulation, which may give better or worse results.
Useful tips
Pop up the Run Command window (Alt; F2 by default) and type:
man: command for man pages. It even unpacks on the fly if the man pages are gzipped.
info: command for info pages.
help: kdeappname for & kde; application help pages.
To move a window, use Alt; left mouse button. Alt; right mouse button will resize the window. Last but not least, Alt; middle mouse button raises/ lowers the window. The kde; Control Center allows you to change these mouse bindings.
There is a standard keybinding (Ctrl; Alt; Esc;) that gives you a skull & crossbones cursor. Click that cursor on a window to kill it. The keybindings are viewable/ changeable from the kde; Control Center.
ps -aux _BAR_ more
kill -9 pid
You can switch back to the desktop with Ctrl; Alt; F7 (or F8 through F9 depending on your operating system) to see if things work again. When you press Alt; Tab you should get a response from the window manager. If not, you need to get back to the text console and try to kill another process.
Good candidates to kill are: the application you were working with, & kicker;, & klipper; and & kdesktop;.
Webbrowsing with & konqueror;
& konqueror; is & kde; 's open source, standards compliant webbrowser. It's home page is http: / /www. konqueror. org where a & konqueror; specific FAQ can be found.
Can I run & konqueror; without running & kde;?
In & konqueror;, select Settings Configure Konqueror... and in the configuration dialog, select Browser Identification. Default and site-specific browser identifications can be set from here.
Quite often & konqueror; loading webpages slowly is caused by DNS servers with broken IPV6 support. Adding the following to / etc/ profile or any other script that is sourced on login should solve this problem: export KDE_NO_IPV6=true for bourne compatible shells, and for C-style shells:
setenv KDE_NO_IPV6 true
Choose Settings Configure & konqueror;... from & konqueror; 's menubar and then select Java & Javascript. Set the Path to Java executable correctly. If it does n't work, please check the Konqueror + Java HOWTO.
& konqueror; has a new'smart 'policy for JavaScript popups. From the & konqueror; main window, select Settings Configure & konqueror;... and then Java & JavaScript. On the JavaScript tab, under Global JavaScript Policies set the radio button beside Open new windows: to Smart.
Make sure you have Javascript enabled, and the default JavaScript web popups policy set to Ask or Allow. The Smart policy is not always sufficient for some banks. Many banks also require & Java; support. You can find more help on enabling this at http: / /www. konqueror. org/.
Can & konqueror; use user-specified stylesheets, like those in the Firefox adblock extention?
An example of css rules that implement ad blocking can be found at: http: / /www. mozilla. org/ support/ firefox/ adblock.
In & konqueror;, go to Settings Configure & konqueror;... and then to the File Associations page.
Open text- > html in the tree view.
Yes. Please refer to "The K Window Manager Handbook" for the list of shortcuts available.
Yes. Launch the kde; Control Center and select Regional & Accessibility Keyboard Shortcuts to configure window manager bindings like maximizing windows, & etc;.
When I "iconify" a window, it disappears. Where does it go?
What is shading a window?
Use the kstart command. As an example, to open & kcalc; with the Stay on Top option, use:
% kstart --ontop kcalc
For maximized windows, use the --maximize option, for minimized windows, use --iconify. You can see a full list of kstart options with kstart --help-all.
If you're using kstart to start applications at & kde; startup, you should use the --window option. See the & kde; User Guide, section Advanced Window Management for more information about this feature.

Web Shortcuts
Introduction
& konqueror; offers some features to enhance your browsing experience. One such feature is Web Shortcuts.
Uniform Resource Identifier. A standardized way of referring to a resource such as a file on your computer, a World Wide Web address, an email address, etc....
Web shortcuts, on the other hand, let you come up with new pseudo & URL; schemes, or shortcuts, that basically let you parameterize commonly used & URI; s. For example, if you like the Google search engine, you can configure & kde; so that a pseudo & URL; scheme like gg will trigger a search on Google. This way, typing gg: my query will search for my query on Google.
One can see why we call these pseudo & URL; schemes. They are used like a & URL; scheme, but the input is not properly & URL; encoded, so one will type google: kde apps and not google: kde+apps.
You can change the contents of either the Search URI or the URI Shortcuts text box. Click OK to save your changes or Cancel to exit the dialog with no changes.
You can also have shortcuts without parameters. Suppose the & URI; was file: / home/ me/ mydocs/ kofficefiles/ kword and the shortcut was mykword. Then, typing mykword: is the same as typing the complete & URI;. Note that there is nothing after the colon when typing the shortcut, but the colon is still required in order for the shortcut to be recognized as such.

File Associations
& Mike. McBride; & Mike. McBride. mail;
KDE
files association
association
Introduction
In the example above, the & kword; Data file is associated with & kword; (the application). These file associations are crucial to the functioning of & kde;.
Unfortunately, & kde; can not:
Each file association is recorded as a mime type. & MIME; stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It allows a computer to determine the type of file, without opening and analyzing the format of each and every file.
Application
Audio
Image
Inode
Message
Multipart
Print
Text
Video
The categories are listed in the box labeled Known Types.
Simply type the first letter of the & MIME; type you are interested in. The categories are automatically expanded, and only the mime-types that include that letter are displayed.
Adding a new mime type
Removing a mime type
If you want to remove a & MIME; type, simply select the & MIME; type you want to delete by clicking once with the mouse on the & MIME; type name. Then click the button labeled Remove. The & MIME; type will be deleted immediately.
You will notice the current values are split into two tabs: General and Embedding
General
There are 4 properties for each & MIME; type in this tab:
Filename Patterns is a search pattern which & kde; will use to determine the & MIME; type.
Description is a short description of the file type. This is for your benefit only.
Application Preference Order determines which applications will be associated with the specified & MIME; type.
Embedding Tab
To change the icon, simply click on the Icon button. A dialog box will appear, which will show you all available icons. Simply click once with the mouse on the icon of your choice, and click OK.
Editing the mime-type patterns
The box labeled Filename Patterns, determines what files will be included within this mime-type.
Usually, files are selected based on their suffix. (Examples: Files that end with. wav are sound files, using the WAV format and files that end in. c are program files written in C).
You should enter your filename mask in this combo box.
The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that will be used with nearly every mime type mask. A complete discussion of wildcards is beyond the scope of this manual, but it is important to understand that the asterisk (in this context), matches any number of characters. As an example: *. pdf will match Datafile. pdf, Graphics. pdf and User. pdf, but not PDF, Datafile. PDF, or. pdf.
It is very beneficial to have multiple masks. One for lower case, one for upper case, & etc; This will help ensure that & kde; can determine the file type more accurately.
Editing a mime types description.
The list box lists all of the applications associated with a specific & MIME; type. The list is in a specific order. The top application is the first application tried. The next application down the list is the second, & etc;.
What do you mean there is more than one application per & MIME; type? Why is this necessary?
As an example:
For the & MIME; type pdf, there are two applications associated with this file type. The first program is called & okular;. If your system does not have & okular; installed, then & kde; automatically starts the second application & krita;. As you can see, this will help keep & kde; running strong as you add and subtract applications.
You can add new applications to the list by clicking the button labeled Add. A dialog box will appear. Using the dialog box, you can select the application you want to use for this mime type. Click OK when you are done, and the application will be added to the current list.
Embedding
By clicking on the Embedding tab, you are presented with four radio buttons in the Left click action group. These determine how the filemanager views the selected & MIME; type:
If this is selected, the file will be shown within the filemanager window.
This will cause a separate window to be created when showing this mime-type.
This will cause the mime-type to use the settings for the mime-type group. (if you are editing an audio mime type, then the settings for the audio group are used).
Below this is a listbox labeled Services Preference Order.
You can use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the order.

However, to make use of this feature, ht: / /dig has to be installed on your system and & kde; has to be configured to make use of it. This control module tries to help you doing the latter. If you have n't installed ht: / /dig and it was n't shipped with your operating system you have to get ht: / /dig yourself. Have a look at the ht: / /dig homepage on how to download and install it.
When you first start, you are in display mode only. To modify your settings, click on Administrator Mode. If you are logged in as root, you will go straight to the change dialog. If not, & kde; will ask for a superuser password.
Use
where to find the ht: / /dig programs KDE uses for fulltext search
The ht: / /dig Programs
There are three programs & kde; needs that come with ht: / /dig: htdig, htsearch and htmerge. For each program you have to provide the full path including the program name, for example: / usr/ bin/ htdig.
Where exactly these programs are installed depends on your operating system or your distribution. However, there are some good guesses you might want to try:
htdig and htmerge are often found in / usr/ bin/ or in something like / usr/ local/ www/ htdig/ bin/.
the htsearch command is often found in a sub folder called cgi-bin, for example / usr/ local/ httpd/ cgi-bin/.
To find out where for example htdig is installed you can always type whereis htdig on the console. whereis will look for the specified command in the standard execution path folders. However, folders like cgi-bin are often not in the standard execution path.

Icons
Introduction
& kde; comes with a full set of icons in several sizes. These icons are being used all over & kde;: the desktop, the panel, the & konqueror; file manager, in every toolbar of every & kde; application, etc. The icons control module offers you very flexible ways of customizing the way & kde; handles icons.
configure these settings for each of the different places icons will be used in: for example the desktop, toolbars & etc;
Please note that some of these settings may depend on your selected icon theme. & kde; comes with three icon themes by default, Oxygen, Monochrome and Crystal SVG. There are additional color themes in the kdeartwork package.
Theme
At the top is a preview of the current theme icons. Most default installations will have only one icon theme available, the & kde; default Oxygen theme. There are other themes contained separately in the kdeartwork package, and you can also download more from the Internet from http: / /www. kde-look. org.
Advanced
An area labelled Use of Icon. Here you can choose which particular usage of icons you want to configure, for example Toolbar or Panel.
When you want to configure icons, first select the usage of icons you want to configure. Change the settings until you like the preview. You can then choose a different icon usage and configure that. At the end, if you are satisfied with your settings, click OK or Apply to take the changes in effect.
There are two further options to consider, Size and Effects.
Icon Size
You have two options relating to icon sizes. First, you can choose from a list of icon sizes. Second, you can tell & kde; to draw all icons using double sized pixels. The largest icon sizes are especially useful for visually impaired people.
Effects
Default
This is how the icon will look normally.
The following effects can be applied to icons:
Icons will be used without applying any effect.
This filter will apply a grayish look to the icon. Click Setup... to configure the intensity of this filter. Note that it is customary for most user interfaces to use this effect for disabled icons only.
Icons will be colorized using a custom color. For example, you may configure active icons (ie; the icon the mouse cursor is over) to shine golden. Use the color and Amount buttons to configure the used color and the intensity of the colorization.
Icons will be drawn desaturated. This is quite similar to the Color setting on your television. Click Setup... to configure the amount of desaturation.
Icons will be drawn using only the two colours selected.

Your choices here affect every & kde; application that renders HTML with & kde; 's own renderer, which is called khtml. These include & kmail;, & khelpcenter; and of course & konqueror;. Choices here do not affect other browsers such as & Netscape;.
This section contains the following options:
& kde; will use the default stylesheet. Some of the colors will default to those defined in your chosen color scheme. Most settings are easily overridden by the page you are viewing.
& kde; will use a stylesheet that you have written yourself. You can use the browse button to locate the stylesheet on your system. CSS files traditionally have a. css extension, but this is not required.
Use the settings defined in the Customize dialog. Enabling this option will enable the Customize button lo launch a dialog to define stylesheet settings.

Choose a font family to use for body text.
Font Size
This is the default size for text on the page. Many web sites set their font sizes relative to this default, using larger or +1 to make the text bigger, and smaller or -1 to make the text smaller.
Do not forget you can also have & konqueror; enforce a minimum size, so that text is never too small to read.

Login Manager
In order to organize all of these options, this module is divided into six sections: Appearance, Font, Background, Sessions, Users and Convenience.
Appearance
From this page you can change the visual appearance of & kdm;, & kde; 's graphical login manager.
If you chose Show logo you can now choose a logo:
Drop an image file on the image button.
If you do not specify a logo the default $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ kdm/ pics/ kdelogo. png will be displayed.
Font
The Greeting font is the font used for the title (Greeting String).
The Fail font is used when a login fails.
The Standard font is used in all other places in the login window.
An example of each font can be seen in the Example Box.
Background
Flat
Pattern
By choosing this mode, you select two colors (using both color buttons).
You then select a pattern by clicking Setup. This opens a new dialog window, which gives you the opportunity to select a pattern. Simply click once on the pattern of your choice, then click on OK, and & kde; will render the pattern you selected using the two colors you selected. For more on patterns, see the section Background: Adding, Removing and Modifying Patterns.
Background Program
By selecting this option, you can have & kde; use an external program to determine the background. This can be any program of your choosing. For more information on this option, see the section entitled Background: Using an external program.
Horizontal Gradient
Vertical Gradient
Pyramid Gradient
Pipecross Gradient
Elliptic Gradient
The setup button is only needed for if you select Background program or Patterns. In these instances, another window will appear to configure the specifics.
Wallpaper
The image can be displayed in six different ways:
No wallpaper
No image is displayed. Just the background colors.
Centered
The image will be centered on the screen. The background colors will be present anywhere the image does not cover.
Tiled
Center Tiled
Centered Maxpect
Scaled
The image will be scaled to fit the desktop. It will be stretched to fit all four corners.
Sessions
None: No one can shutdown the computer using & kdm;. You must be logged in, and execute a command.
All: Everyone can shutdown the computer using & kdm;.
Root only: & kdm; requires that the root password be entered before shutting down the computer.
Console only: The user must be at this console, to shut down the computer.
Commands
Use these 3 blanks to define the exact shutdown command.
The shutdown command defaults to:
/ sbin/ shutdown
The restart command defaults to:
/ sbin/ reboot
The Console mode (which restarts the computer as a console only terminal) defaults to:
/ sbin/ init 3
Session types
For more information on this subject, look at / etc/ X11/ xdm/ Xsession to find your xdm setup files. Also review the xdm man pages, especially under the SESSION PROGRAM section.
To add a session, type its name in the blank entitled New types, and click Add new.
To remove a session, select the session from the list and click Remove.
Users
Show all users but no-show users: If this option is selected, all users will be listed, except those users contained in the list entitled No show users. If Show users is not checked, this has no effect.
Select users
Images
This section of the manual only applies if Show users is selected. If it is not, this image box has no effect.
Every user on the system can be represented by a image. The image for the user is kept in a file called $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ kdm/ pics/ users/ $USER. xpm. If the user does n't have such a file the file $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ kdm/ pics/ users/ default. xpm will be used instead.

Introduction
As & Netscape; 's Navigator has been a web browsing standard for many years, so-called & Netscape; plugins have appeared that allow rich web content. Using those plugins, web sites can contain PDF files, flash animations, video, & etc; With & konqueror;, you can still use these plugins to take advantage of rich web content.
& Netscape; plugins should not be confused with & konqueror; plugins. The latter ones specifically extend & konqueror; 's functionality; they are normally not used to display rich web content.

& konqueror; instances
Your options are:
Never
There are no restraints. Any number of & konqueror; instances can be open at any one time. The advantage of this option is if any & konqueror; instance crashes the remaining will be unaffected. The disadvantage is that each & konqueror; instance uses more memory.
Always (use with care)
Preloading
The subsection labeled Preloading also makes a tradeoff between memory and performance.
The check box labeled Preload an instance after & kde; startup does just what it says. It tells & kde; to preload one instance of & konqueror; at the startup of & kde;.
This does extend the startup time for & kde;.

Windows shares
Windows Shares
Introduction
In many small local area networks, the SMB protocol is used to offer network services. Names like Windows; Network or Windows; for Workgroups Network or LanManager are often used as well. Using SMB you can access so-called shares (ie; folders made available by the server) as well as printers.
For the SMB protocol to work, it is required to have Samba correctly installed. If you have an NT domain controller, you will need at least Samba version 2.0 or higher. If you want to access & Windows; 2000 shares, you will need Samba version 2.0.7 or higher. Older versions may work too, but have not been tested.
Use
KControl
If the option Show hidden shares is checked, shares ending with a $will be shown.
Spell Checker
KDE
Spelling
dictionary
Spell Options
If this box is not checked, then words that appear in the dictionary separately, but have been run together, are considered to be spelling errors. Examples of such words are shutout, cannot, and blackout.
Create root/ affix combinations not in dictionary
You should select the one that matches the character set you are using. In some cases, dictionaries will support more than one encoding. A dictionary might, for example, accept accented characters when Latin1 is selected, but accept email-style character combinations (like'a for an accented a) when 7-Bit-ASCII is selected. Please see your dictionary's distribution for more information.
You can choose which of the installed client applications on your system to use. For example, you can choose ispell.

identification
Introduction
Use
In this module you can configure the type of browser that & konqueror; will report itself to be. You can control this information by web site. Usually, the list box that is labeled Site Specific Identification will be empty, so that & konqueror; will always use its default useragent string.
Note that you can not use the wildcard character * in this text box. However, the string kde. org will match all hosts in the domain kde. org
The Delete button can be used to delete the selected entry in the list of configured agent bindings. The Delete All will remove all the configured user agent strings. Click the Apply to take your changes in effect.
KControl
In the field labeled Alias (description) you can enter a descriptive name for the configured binding, & eg; Netscape Navigator 4.75 on Linux for the useragent string Mozilla/ 4.75 (X11; U; Linux 2.2.14 i686).

KDebugdialog
What is & kdebugdialog;?
Note that kWarning, kError and kFatal always appear, they are NOT controlled by this setting.
Area
The areas which should only be output. Every message that is not mentioned here will simply not be output (unless this field remains empty, which is the default, and means that all messages should be output). You can enter several areas separated by commas here, and you can also use area ranges with the syntax start-end. Thus a valid entry could be: 117,214-289,356-359,221. Do not use whitespaces.
Information
Warning
Error
Fatal Error
For each of these types, you can set the following:
Apart from this, you can also tick the check box Abort on fatal errors. In this case, if a diagnostic message with the severity level KDEBUG_FATAL is output, the application aborts with a SIGABRT after outputting the message.
When you close the dialog by pressing OK, your entries apply immediately and are saved in kdebugrc. When you press Cancel, your entries are discarded and the old ones are restored.

Installation
& khelpcenter; is an integral part of the & kde; Base installation, and is installed with every copy of & kde;. It can be found in the kdebase-runtime package, and is available from the & kde-ftp;, or will be found in your operating system's kdebase-runtime package.
Invoking Help
& khelpcenter; can be called in several ways:
From the Help menu
The most common will probably be from within an application. Choose F1 Help Applicationapos; s Handbook to open that application's handbook.
& khelpcenter; may be started using a & URL; to display a file. & URL; s have been added for info and man pages also. You can use them as follows:
khelpcenter help: / kedit
Opens the & kedit; help file, at the contents page.
A local & URL;
khelpcenter file: / usr/ local/ src/ qt/ html/ index. html
A Man page
khelpcenter man: / strcpy
An Info page
khelpcenter info: / gcc
Invoking khelpcenter with no parameters opens the default welcome page.
The & khelpcenter; interface
The & khelpcenter; interface consists of two panes of information.
The toolbar and menus are explained further in.
The Contents pane
The Contents Menu
The Contents contains the following default entries:
& kde; User's manual
The & kde; User's manual is an in-depth exploration of & kde;, including installation, configuration and customization, and use.
Application manuals
Native & kde; application documentation. All & kde; applications have documentation in & XML; format, which are converted to HTML when you view them. This section lists all the & kde; applications with a brief description and a link to the full application documentation.
Tutorials
Short, task based or informational tutorials.
& UNIX; man pages are the traditional on-line documentation format for & UNIX; systems. Most programs on your system will have a man page. In addition, man pages exist for programming functions and file formats.
Browse info pages
TeXinfo documentation is used by many & GNU; applications, including gcc (the C/ C++ compiler), emacs, and many others.

Info documents are arranged hierarchically with each page called a node. All info documents have a Top node, & ie; the opening page. You can return to the Top of an info document by pressing Top.
Prev & Next are used to move to the previous/ next page at the current level of the hierarchy.
Man is treated similarly to info, with the section index being the Top node and each man page on the level below. Man entries are one page long.
The & kde; glossary
In the left hand pane you will see a tree view, with two choices: Alphabetically or By topic. Both contain the same entries, sorted differently, to allow you to quickly find the item of interest.

Sharing data with & kontact; via IMAP
Introduction
For small offices and needs, you can have & kontact; use shared data without the need of installing the Kolab server or another groupware backend. It can work with just an IMAP server, that can be easily set up.
My scenario is a server with Debian unstable and & kde; 3.4. I access & kontact; and other fabulous GNU/ Linux apps from windows using Cygwin/ X, while waiting Wine project to be able to run the last Windows programs I need (and that are not available under GNU/ Linux). I want to share contacts, events, todo, notes with my secretary.
What is IMAP
So it can be considered a data storage. To use it you you need an IMAP server, such as Cyrus, Courier or UW.
Kolab or IMAP?
You will have a configuration interface which does user management, mail account setup, a central LDAP config data and addressbook server, spam and virus filtering, vacation scripts, free busy list handling, resource handling (rooms, cars), groups, distribution lists, automatic invitation handling, & etc;
But that can cause initial setup troubles. For a newbie like me it means: a long long frustrating nightmare, and too much complexity to manage once working. So no, thanks, I'll go to simple IMAP.
Let's start the installation and the setup!
# apt-get install cyrus21-imapd cyrus21-common cyrus21-admin cyrus21-client sasl-bin sasl2-bin Installing cyrus21-imapd... The installer asks something I've not understood about an search address... I just pressed Enter.
The installer also created the user cyrus that is in the (automatically created) group sasl, that is the owner of all cyrus files. At the end with ps -A you can find the new processes: cyrmaster and notifyd.
Cyrus can use different SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) mechanisms, the default being sasldb (it stores usernames and passwords in the SASL secrets file sasldb), but also getpwent, kerberos4, kerberos5, PAM, rimap, shadow and LDAP are supported.
To do so we have to tell sasl to use saslauthd as password authentication method, and then setup saslauthd to use shadow (or getpwent) as the authentication mechanism.
As root, change the Linux password of cyrus user:
# passwd cyrus
# vi / etc/ imapd. conf
sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd instead of the default auxprop
remove the # remark from the line:
#admins: cyrus
this way you can administer cyrus logging in as cyrus user (what a fantasy I have!)
# vi / etc/ default/ saslauthd
Uncomment the line:
# START=yes
(otherwise the saslauthd will not start at boot time, even if referenced in some / etc/ rcx. d!)
and instead of MECHANISMS="pam "put MECHANISMS="shadow" this way at the boot a saslauthd -a shadow will be executed.
Once exited from your editor, restart sasl and cyrus.
To test IMAP:
su cyrus $imtest -m login -p imap localhost
You are prompted for the cyrus (user) password, so enter it.
If the user cyrus is correctly authenticated, the following lines will appear:
S: L01 OK User logged in Authenticated.
To exit type. logout (ie; dot space logout)
Now I have to create the user and an IMAP in cyrus also:
# cyradm --user cyrus localhost after entering the password for the admin user cyrus, you get the prompt localhostgt; localhostgt; cm user. groupware localhostgt; lm lists the mailbox only just created user. groupware (\\HasNoChildren)) localhostgt; quit
You can type help for a list of available commands.
You can check what has happened with:
# ls -l / var/ spool/ cyrus/ mail/ g/ user/ groupware total 12 -rw------- 1 cyrus mail 4 Oct 29 20:55 cyrus. cache -rw------- 1 cyrus mail 155 Oct 29 20:55 cyrus. header -rw------- 1 cyrus mail 76 Oct 29 20:55 cyrus. index
Now you should be able to connect with an IMAP client as the groupware user and see the INBOX.
In the IMAP protocol, selecting the mailbox INBOX is a magic word, a sort of alias for the above directory structure. The client sees INBOX, and the IMAP server maps it in the / var/ spool/ cyrus/ mail/... folder and file structure.
To have & kontact; work with IMAP, there are these steps to complete:
Create an IMAP account on the Cyrus for fake groupware user (already previously done!)
Enable groupware functionality and make related subfolders of that IMAP INBOX (if not already)
Enjoy & kontact; and shared data through Cyrus IMAP
So login to & kde; with the first real user account you want to provide groupware functionality to.
Let's create the IMAP account in & kmail;.
Run & kontact; and select Mail (the & kmail; component). From the menu choose Settings Configure KMail Accounts Receiving tab, press the Add... button. You will then be prompted for the type of your email account, and select disconnected IMAP (not just IMAP). Then in the General tab enter the following data:
A name that will be used for the local folder that points to this IMAP account.
The password of the groupware user.
The default
Check store IMAP password so you will not be asked for it next time you run & kontact;. Check the Enable interval mail checking and set a value in minutes.
Now we have to tell & kontact; to use IMAP as the data source for its various components. From the & kmenu;, choose Run command, run kcmshell4 kresources. In the combo box select Contacts, then press the Add... button, and choose Addressbook on IMAP Server via KMail. Then select that new line and press Use as Standard button. Do the same for Calendar and Notes.
Choose from the menu Settings Configure KMail Misc Groupware
Check Enable IMAP resource functionality
Now move to Resource folder are in account and select the Inbox subfolder of the office_gwdata folder.
Leave Hide groupware folders unchecked for now, so we can see that happens. You can return here and check it once everything is clear.
If you do not want this, press No, and the IMAP resource will be disabled. Press Yes (this happens only the first time with the first real user). You will immediately see that in the & kmail; folder tree, under office_gwdata Inbox these subfolders are created:
Calendar
Contacts
Notes
Tasks
Journal
if you now do a:
# ls -l / var/ spool/ cyrus/ mail/ g/ user/ groupware/ drwx------ 2 cyrus mail 144 Oct 31 16:36 Calendar drwx------ 2 cyrus mail 144 Oct 31 16:36 Contacts drwx------ 2 cyrus mail 144 Oct 31 16:36 Journal drwx------ 2 cyrus mail 144 Oct 31 16:36 Notes drwx------ 2 cyrus mail 144 Oct 31 16:36 Tasks -rw------- 1 cyrus mail 4 Oct 31 15:28 cyrus. cache -rw------- 1 cyrus mail 155 Oct 29 20:55 cyrus. header -rw------- 1 cyrus mail 76 Oct 31 15:28 cyrus. index
As you see, the office_gwdata Inbox is stored not local to the & kontact; current user home, but in the IMAP groupware user's folders.
Now & kontact; is ready to work and store data there. In the calendar application, if & kmail; IMAP account was of type disconnected, the resource window should display the item Imap resource with 3 subitems, that are paths to local home files. Instead, the Contacts application does not show subitems below the Imap resource.
Open & kontact; and in the Mail component add an IMAP account specifying as host the computer where Cyrus server runs (in my case: 192.168.1.3).
Activate the groupware functionality to be able to save data in the IMAP server.
In the previous setup, we have the same fake user, named groupware, that is used by all the real & kontact; users (ie; tony, rohn, amanda, & etc;) through the IMAP account with its login and password. But this way every real user has the same read/ write permissions of the others, since everyone connects as the user groupware to the IMAP server.
To limit access to some users (typically, providing read-only access), we can use the ACL (Access Control Lists).
Select in & kmail; a subfolder of office_gwdata inbox, for instance Calendar, and right click the mouse. Select Properties Access Control tab. Here you can enter the users you want give access to this folder and what they can do.
At cyrus level (in the PC that runs IMAP server cyrus, with cyrus tools), we first need to add the user mary, so it's an IMAP recognized user, and create an IMAP folder for her.
Then we login to GNU/ Linux as mary and enter & kontact;. As previously shown, we will setup an IMAP account in & kmail; with the same data but the one of the user (instead of the fake user groupware and its password, we will use mary and her password).
In & kmail; folder tree, this time you will see this structure: office_gwdata user groupware Calendar and Tasks. Check the mail (File Check Mail) and you will also have an inbox folder under office_gwdata.
Now enable & kmail; groupware functionality, and in Resource folders are subfolders of put the inbox that is subfolder of office_gwdata.
inbox with Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Tasks and Journal, that are saved on mary IMAP folders on the IMAP server

Internet Shortcuts
gg:
Internet shortcuts are a really useful feature of & konqueror;: once you get used to them, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.
To see what internet shortcuts are, open up & konqueror; and type gg: kde in the Location bar.
You will go to Google, searching for & kde;.
They are many such shortcuts like ggl: (Google I'm feeling lucky), bug: (bugs. kde. org) and so on.
In Keyword delimiter you can choose if you want to separate a shortcut with a colon (gg: kde) or a space (gg kde).
A nice tip with Internet shortcuts is that you can use them from the Run Command dialog. Just open it (through the & kmenu; or with Alt; F2) and type your shortcut, & eg; gg: kde, and press & Enter;. It will automatically open & konqueror; with a Google search for & kde;.

Overview
Directory Layout
By default & kde; uses two directory trees:
One at the system level (for example / opt/ kde3).
$HOME /. kde
/ opt/ kde3. (This is & SuSE; -specific; other distributions may use / usr or / usr/ kde3)
/ etc/ opt/ kde3. (This was added by & SuSE;).
If you have the KIOSK Admin tool v0.7 or later installed you can check which directory trees are used with the following command: kiosktool-kdedirs --check
For information about the text/ plain & MIME; type the following files are searched:
$HOME /. kde/ share/ mimelnk/ text/ plain. desktop
/ opt/ kde3/ share/ mimelnk/ text/ plain. desktop
/ etc/ opt/ kde3/ share/ mimelnk/ text/ plain. desktop
If a user makes a change, the change is written to $HOME /. kde/ share/ mimelnk/ text/ plain. desktop
$HOME /. kde/ share/ config/ foobar
Color=red Shape=circle
/ etc/ opt/ kde3/ share/ config/ foobar
Color=blue Position=10,10

KDEHOME
~/. kde
KDEROOTHOME
/ root/. kde
Different variable to prevent root writing to $KDEHOME of the user after running su.
KDEDIR
/ opt/ kde3, / usr, / usr/ kde3
Vendor dependent. Used by & kde; 2. If not set, falls back to compiled-in default.
KDEDIRS
New in & kde; 3. Can list multiple locations separated by a colon. If not set, falls back to $KDEDIR
Do n't need to be set, defaults work just fine.
Running & kde; 2 next to & kde; 3? Point $KDEDIR to & kde; 2 and $KDEDIRS to & kde; 3.
KDEHOME='~/. kde3 'KDEROOTHOME='/ root/. kde3' KDEDIRS='/ opt/ kde_staff: / opt/ kde3 '
User Profiles
[Directories-staff] prefixes=/ opt/ kde_staff
This creates a profile named staff that adds the / opt/ kde_staff directory tree. (Note that & SuSE; & Linux; uses / etc/ kde3rc instead of / etc/ kderc. Now that we have a named profile it can be assigned to users.
[Directories] userProfileMapFile=/ etc/ kde-user-profile

The & kde; Startup Script: startkde
LD_BIND_NOW=true kdeinit4 +kcminit_startup and kwrapper4 ksmserver $KDEWM
The first line starts the kdeinit4 master process. The kdeinit4 master process is used to start all other & kde; processes. It show up in the output of ps aux as kdeinit4: Running.... The arguments after kdeinit4 are the names of additional processes to be started. The + indicates that kdeinit4 needs to wait till the process has finished. kdeinit4 also starts klauncher and kded.

kdeinit
The drawback is that programs started this way appear as kdeinit in the output of top and ps. Use top -c or ps aux to see the actual program name:
% ps aux waba 23184 0.2 2.1 23428 11124? S 21:41 0:00 kdeinit4: Running... waba 23189 0.2 2.4 25136 12496? S 21:41 0:00 kdeinit4: klauncher waba 23192 0.7 2.8 25596 14772? S 21:41 0:00 kdeinit4: kded waba 23203 0.8 3.4 31516 17892? S 21:41 0:00 kdeinit4: knotify
kdeinit: Running... indicates the master kdeinit process. The other processes listed are programs started as KLM s.
When kdeinit starts for the first time it will launch klauncher, and kded, as well as any additional programs specified on its command line in the startkde script, normally kcminit_startup.
kcminit
kcminit executes initialization services during startup. Initialization services are specified in the. desktop files of applications or services via the X-KDE-Init line:
[Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8 Exec=kcmshell4 energy Icon=energy_star Type=Application X-KDE-Library=energy X-KDE-Init=energy
klauncher can be restarted by restarting kdeinit from a console window. Make sure that $HOME, $DISPLAY and the various $KDEDIR(S) are set correctly when doing so!
KSMServer
The ktip. desktop file for example contains:
X-KDE-autostart-condition=ktiprc: TipOfDay: RunOnStart: true
Some of the applications auto-started by ksmserver are:
kdesktop
The & kde; desktop
& kicker;
The & kde; panel
ktip
kwrited
& klipper;

Environment variables
$KDEDIR
$KDEDIRS
$KDEHOME
If not set, & kde; uses ~/. kde as the directory where personal data is stored.
$KDEROOTHOME
If not set, & kde; uses ~root/. kde as the directory for root's personal data. Was introduced to prevent & kde; from accidently overwriting user data with root permissions when the user runs a & kde; program after switching with su to root.
$KDEWM
$KDE_LANG
$KDE_MULTIHEAD
(Since & kde; 3.2.3) Set this variable to spawn KIO -slaves directly from the application process itself. By default KIO -slaves are spawned using klauncher / kdeinit. This option is useful if the KIO -slave should run in the same environment as the application. This can be the case with Clearcase.
(Since & kde; 3.2.3) - Set this variable to disable IPv6 support and IPv6 DNS lookups.
(Since & kde; 3.2) - Set this variable to indicate that you have prelinked your & kde; binaries and libraries. This will turn off kdeinit.
$KDESYCOCA
$KDETMP
$KDEVARTMP
Allows to specify another path than / var/ tmp where & kde; stores its variable files.
(Since & kde; 3.2) Defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for data files in addition to the $XDG_DATA_HOME base directory. Default is / usr/ local/ share/: / usr/ share/
& kde; adds locations from $KDEDIRS and profiles as well. Used for. desktop and. directory menu files.. desktop files under $XDG_DATA_DIRS / applications.. directory files under $XDG_DATA_DIRS/ desktop-directories
(kde; 3.2) - Defines the base directory relative to which user specific configuration files should be stored. Default is $HOME /. config.
(kde; 3.2) - Defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for configuration files in addition to the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME base directory. The default is / etc/ xdg & kde; adds locations from $KDEDIRS and profiles as well. Used by. menu descriptions in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS / menus.

& kde; Menu
In & kde; 3.2 a common menu format is introduced at http: / /freedesktop. org/ Standards/ menu-spec/
Before & kde; 3.2:
Directory structure under share/ applnk
is shared between GNOME and & kde;
Supports applnk style menus as well
Example from applications. menu:
& lt; Menugt; & lt; Namegt; Officelt; /Namegt; & lt; Directorygt; suse-office. directorylt; /Directorygt; & lt; Includegt; & lt; Filenamegt; Acrobat Reader. desktoplt; /Filenamegt; & lt; Filenamegt; kde-kpresenter. desktoplt; /Filenamegt; & lt; Filenamegt; kde-kword. desktoplt; /Filenamegt; & lt; /Includegt; & lt; Menugt;
Menu entry with 3 applications:
/ usr/ share/ applications/ Acrobat Reader. desktop
/ opt/ kde3/ share/ applications/ kde/ kpresenter. desktop
/ opt/ kde3/ share/ applications/ kde/ kword. desktop
Stored Where?
. menu files describing the menu structure. The files are stored in $KDEDIR / etc/ xdg/ menus and / etc/ xdg/ menus. These store the system-wide menu structure and are controlled by $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS. $HOME /. config/ menus stores user-specific changes to the menu structure and is controlled by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME. For more information, see http: / /www. freedesktop. org/ Standards/ basedir-spec.
. desktop files describe the applications and are stored in: $KDEDIR / share/ applications, / usr/ share/ applications, / usr/ local/ share/ applications. These are the system-wide application. desktop files which are controlled by $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
$HOME /. local/ applications contains user-specific. desktop files and user-specific changes. It is controlled by $XDG_DATA_HOME. For more information, see http: / /www. freedesktop. org/ Standards/ basedir-spec

Common Pitfalls
Essential Menus
$KDEDIR / etc/ xdg/ menus/ applications-merged/ contains kde-essential. menu which includes some essential menus that are normally not shown in the & kde; menu itself:
Screensavers contains a hidden System/ Screensavers menu, whose contents are defined by kde-screensavers. menu and whose icon and name are defined by kde-system-screensavers. directory. $KDEDIR / share/ desktop-directories/ kde-system-screensavers. directory contains:
NoDisplay=true
Old-Style Menus
KSycoca
KSycoca caches menu structure and information about all available applications. You can rebuild the database with kbuildsycoca4. The database which is built lives in / var/ tmp/ kdecache-${ USER }/ ksycoca. It is automatically updated by KDED, checked during & kde; login, and KDED watches for changes while logged in.
[General] CheckSycoca=false
To force regeneration, run touch $KDEDIR / share/ services/ update_ksycoca.
& kmenuedit;
& kmenuedit; is aimed at a single user setup. Changes to menu structure are saved to ~/. config/ menus/ applications-kmenuedit. menu, changes to applications are saved in ~/. local/ share/ applications/ and changes to sub-menus (icon, name) are saved in ~/. local/ share/ desktop-directories/. The KIOSK Admin Tool uses & kmenuedit; and copies the above changes to profile- or system-wide locations.

: local
Protocols that access locally stored information, examples are file: /, man: /, fonts: /, floppy: /
: internet
Common internet protocols such as http and ftp
Information about protocols is stored in *. protocol files stored in $KDEDIR / share/ services.
The Class = entry defines the group a protocol is part of: grep Class= $KDEDIR / share/ services/ *. protocol
Configuration Modules
To start the Proxy module use:
kcmshell4 kde-proxy. desktop
kcmshell4 proxy
The modules that are visible in the Control Center normally have a. desktop file in $KDEDIR / share/ applications/ kde and are sorted under the hidden Settings-Modules menu by the kde-settings. menu, included from kde-essential. menu
kbuildsycoca4 --menutest 2gt; / dev/ null _BAR_ grep Settings-Modules
Application specific modules normally have a. desktop file under $KDEDIR / share/ applnk/. hidden which corresponds to the hidden. hidden menu, included as a result of lt; KDELegacyDirs/ gt;
kbuildsycoca4 --menutest 2gt; / dev/ null _BAR_ grep. hidden
In & kde; 3.3 it is possible to edit the Control Center with kcontroledit. kcontroledit works just like kmenuedit, changes for current user only. Use kiosktool to make changes for everyone.

kdialog --msgbox'You have new mail! '
kdialog --title'New Mail '--msgbox'You have new mail!'
The KDialog part can be replaced via --caption option
kdialog --title'New Mail '--msgbox'You have new mail!' --dontagain myfile: mykey
[Notification Messages] mykey=false
Instead of --msgbox you can also use --sorry and --error, as appropriate. For instance, you might use kdialog --sorry'The network can not be reached 'or kdialog --error'Mail box can not be opened'.
kdialog --yesno'Do you want to connect to the Internet? 'echo $?
Return Value
Meaning
0
Yes, OK, Continue
1
No
2
Cancel
Further variations are:
--warningyesno
like --yesno but with a different icon
--warningcontinuecancel
With Continue and Cancel buttons.
--warningyesnocancel
With Yes, No and Cancel button. For example:
kdialog --warningyesnocancel'Do you want to save the changes? '
kdialog --inputbox "Enter your name:" "YourName"
password =$( kdialog --password "Enter your password:")
The --dontagain option does not work with --inputbox or --password
--menu
--checklist
Lets the user select one or more items from a list.
city =$( kdialog --menu "Select a city" a London b Madrid c Paris d Berlin)
$city will a, b, c or d.
city =$( kdialog --checklist "Select cities" a London off b Madrid on c Paris on d Berlin off)
Madrid and Paris will be pre-selected. The result with Madrid and Paris selected will be "b" "c".

SSH, sessions, envars, other fun things
Emergency Procedures:
SSH, sessions, envars, other fun things.
When & konsole; is invoked bash specific commands and & kde; specific variables are read and executed from ~/. bashrc or ~/. bash_profile. The preferred configuration file for user environments is ~/. bash_profile, the commands printenv or env can be used to display all currently set variables. To set a variable in the shell use VARNAME= value. For a full list of variables that can be set in & kde; see the wiki.
To rename & konsole; 's session use Ctrl; Alt; S and enter the new name.
If you find the need to run any & kde; program with root privileges, you can use the & kdesu; command with the -c switch from the command line like this: kdesu -c -n PROGRAM, using the -n switch will prevent & kde; from remembering your passwords.

The conventional way of ripping Audio CDs to MP3 or Ogg files is to use a standalone program such as iTunes, Winamp or & kde; 's own KAudioCreator. But if we stick to conventions, where's the fun?! So in this article, I am going to show you how to feel elite by ripping your CDs in the, umm.. elite way.; -)

Recipe
In the screenshot below, you can see the contents of the Ogg Vorbis folder. It shows all the songs in the Ogg format; it even shows their file size! But, you and I both know that audio CDs do n't contain Ogg tracks. So what exactly is happening here?

Make sure that your firewall is not so restrictive that it stops packets to the loopback device. For example in iptables if the default rule on the INPUT chain for this device is set to anything other than > ACCEPT this will cause performance problems in X. To check this, you can type in:
percnt; iptables-save _BAR_ grep lo -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
The rule -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT should always work, unless there are other misconfigured rules (Such as a DROP on the OUTPUT chain)

Introduction
An example of a text file:
[General] AutoSave=1 LastFile=/ var/ tmp/ test. txt
The user-specific configuration files are stored in. kde/ share/ config (replace. kde with your $KDEHOME setting) and the global ones are in the share/ config sub-directory of & kde; 's installation path. (You can find this path by running the command kde4-config --prefix.) Their filenames typically end in rc (without an initial period), for example kopeterc.
Backups
Editing
Anyway, whatever your reason, you want to modify by hand a configuration file.
Ready? So make a backup of the file (Did I tell you this already?), start you favorite editor (let us assume it is & kate;), load the file (Be careful to load as UTF-8, & kate; displays it as utf8).
Now you have a file like:
[Group] Key1=Value1 Key2=Value2 Key3=Value3
You can now modify it (with care!) and then save it (Be sure that it is as UTF-8 again).

Broadly speaking, each & kde; application provides one or more & DCOP; interfaces, which in turn provide methods (or, if you prefer, functions) that another application can call. So, the first step in using & DCOP; is to find the appropriate method for the task. The easiest way to do this is using the kdcop frontend to the available & DCOP; methods.
To test that the function does what we expect, double-click on the setColor entry. To set the color c, click on the color selector button, and choose a color. Set whether the color should be color A with the checkbox. Click OK and the background color is set.
We specify the application, interface and method in that order, followed by the arguments in the same order that they are shown in kdcop. dcop has plenty of other options: take a look at the output of dcop --help.
That's enough theory: time for an example:
To use our setColor method on the command line, we use the following:
% dcop kdesktop KBackgroundIface setColor '#ffffff 'false
To specify the color, we used the hexadecimal RGB value, as used in & HTML;. Note that it is enclosed in single quotes to protect the # from the shell.
So, that's all we need from & DCOP;; now it's just a case of writing a script around it. Here's a (very!) rough implementation:
< ![CDATA[ #!/bin/sh COMICURL=`wget -qO - http://www .userfriendly.org/static/index.html _BAR_\\ grep Latest _BAR_ sed -e "s,. *SRC=\\",, "-e "s,\\" > .*,," ` TMPFILE=`mktemp / tmp/ $0. XXXXXX ` _BAR__BAR_ exit 1 wget -q -O $TMPFILE $COMICURL dcop kdesktop KBackgroundIface setWallpaper $TMPFILE 1]] >
The first line after the #! /bin/ sh uses wget and some regular expression magic to extract the image location from the main page's & HTML; source. The second and third lines download the image, and finally, dcop sets the downloaded image as wallpaper.
Some IBM laptops, for instance, have extra keys about the left and right arrows, which look like page left and page right.
Use xev to find the code of the keys. In this case, they are 233 and 234
Choose key symbols. There are quite a range of these that are not used by default, so many are free. You can find the list in / usr/ X11R6/ include/ X11/ keysymdef. h (or its equivalent on your system).
Create a file in your home directory called. Xmodmap, and add to it the following:
keycode 233 = Next_Virtual_Screen keycode 234 = Prev_Virtual_Screen
Run the command xmodmap ~/. Xmodmap
The xev manpage. You can see this by typing man: / xev into a & konqueror; window or by typing man xev into a terminal.
This can be achieved easily using the following method:
Open & kcontrol;, and in the Regional & Accessibility section, select Input Action
Choose New Action
Select Keyboard shortcut - > Command/ URL (simple) for the Action type:
In the Keyboard Shortcut tab, click the button you wish to use to trigger the command. For this example, you would press the one with the Next Page picture on it. Next_Virtual_Screen will appear in the key image.
In the Command/ URL Settings tab, enter the command to run in the field: dcop kwin default nextDesktop
Repeat the above with the Prev_Virtual_Screen key and dcop kwin default previousDesktop.
Now pressing the Prev_Virtual_Screen or Next_Virtual_Screen will switch you to the previous or next virtual desktop, respectively.
Obviously you can assign any free key to any action.
See the KHotKeys documentation by looking it up in & khelpcenter;, or typing help: / khotkeys in a & konqueror; window.

& kdebugdialog; - Controlling & kde; 's Debugging Output
Basic Usage
KDebugDialog in full mode
In full mode, which is what you get when you start kdebugdialog as kdebugdialog --fullmode, the same list of debugging areas as in plain mode is available, but you can select only one at a time from a drop-down box. You may then independently set the output for various types of messages: Information, Warning, Error and Fatal Error. For each of these types, you can choose where the messages are sent. The choices are:
File, in which case you can enter a filename. This file is written into your $HOME directory.
Message Box. Each debugging message is displayed in an information dialog, which you must OK to continue with the application.
Shell, the default entry. Messages are printed to stderr, and will appear either in the shell window where the application was started, or in. xsession-errors.
Syslog. This sends each debugging message to the system's syslog facility, which can perform its own processing of the message.
None. This suppresses the output of this type of message.

Introduction
The module is divided into four tabs: Bell, Modifier keys, Keyboard Filters and Activation Gestures.
Bell
This panel is divided into an Audible Bell section and a Visible Bell section.
The top check box labeled Use System Bell, determines whether the normal System bell rings. If this option is disabled, the System bell will be silenced.
You can then select between Invert screen, or Flash screen. If you select Invert screen, all colors on the screen will be reversed. If you choose Flash screen, you can choose the color by clicking the button to the right of the Flash screen selection.
The slider bar can be used to adjust the duration of the visible bell. The default value is 500ms, or half a second.
There are two sections to this panel.
If this option is enabled, you can press and release the & Shift;, & Alt; or & Ctrl; keys, and then press another key to get a key combo (example: Ctrl; & Alt; Del could be done with & Ctrl; then & Alt; then Del).
Also in this section is a check box labeled Lock Sticky Keys. If this check box is enabled, the & Alt;, & Ctrl; and & Shift; keys stay selected until you de-selected them.
As an example:
With Lock Sticky Keys disabled:
If you press the & Shift; key then press the F key, the computer interprets this as Shift; F. Now if you type a P, the computer interprets this as the letter p (no shift).
With Lock Sticky Keys enabled:
If you press the & Shift; key twice then press the F key, the computer interprets this as Shift; F. Now if you type a P, the computer interprets this as the letter P (Shift; P). To de-select the & Shift; key, press it again.

Shortcuts
Introduction
Standard shortcuts and Global shortcuts work just the same. Actually, in a certain way standard or application shortcuts are global as well. The only difference is:
Standard keyboard shortcuts refer to actions that are often available in applications, such as Save, Print, Copy & etc;
Global keyboard shortcuts are shortcuts for actions that make sense even when no application is opened. These shortcuts usually refer to actions like switching desktops, manipulating windows & etc;
Default: the selected action will be associated with & kde; 's default value. This is a good choice for most actions, as & kde; comes with reasonable key bindings we have thought about.
Use
No key: the selected action will not be associated with any key.
As with all control modules, your changes wo n't take in effect until you click OK or Apply. Click Cancel to discard all changes.
Configuring Schemes
Modifier Keys
Different keyboards offer different sets of modifier keys. A & Mac; keyboard, for example, does not have a & Ctrl; key, and instead has an Option key. Here you can see what the available modifier keys for the current keyboard are.
If you enable Macintosh keyboard the list of modifiers will change.
If you have enabled the & Mac; keyboard, you can further enable MacOS-style modifier usage, to make & kde; behave more like & MacOS;.
Finally, you can change what a keypress sends to the & X-Server; in the X Modifier Mapping section. A common example is to reconfigure the Caps Lock key, which is rarely used, to be another & Ctrl; key. This is especially nice if you are a touch typist, as Caps Lock is much easier to reach than either of the & Ctrl; keys on a standard keyboard.

Mouse
This module is divided into several tabs: General, Cursor Theme, Advanced and Mouse Navigation. There may also be one or more additional tabs if you have a Logitech mouse or trackball, providing access to special features.
General
Button Order
This is the default setting for & kde;. Clicking once on an icon will open it. To select you can drag around the icon(s) or Ctrl; Right click, or simply click and hold to drag it. You can also enable automatic selection of icons using the Automatically select icons check box, discussed below.
This option should be checked in most situations. It gives more visual feedback and says, in essence, if you click here, something will happen.
Cursor Theme
Advanced
Pointer acceleration
A multiplier between 1x and 3x will works well for many systems. With a multiplier over 3x the mouse pointer may become difficult to control.
Pointer threshold
In general, the higher you set the Pointer acceleration value, the higher you will want to set the Pointer threshold value. For example, a Pointer threshold of 4 pixels may be appropriate for a Pointer Acceleration of 2x, but 10 pixels might be better for 3x.
Mouse Navigation

Mouse Receiver
Dual Receiver
Cordless Freedom Optical
Cordless Elite Duo
MX700 Optical Mouse
Cordless Optical Trackman
Cordless MX Duo Receiver
MX100 Laser Mouse
If the mouse supports resolution switching, the Sensor Resolution radio button group will be enabled, and you can switch from 400 counts per inch to 800 counts per inch and back. If you use 800 counts per inch, the same physical movement of the mouse will cause a greater (roughly double) amount of motion of the cursor. This tends to be popular amongst gamers.
If the mouse supports cordless reporting, the Battery Level and RF Channel widgets will be enabled. You can only change the RF Channel if your mouse has two channel support.
On a & Linux; system, you should use the hotplug system to change the ownership and permissions on the mouse entry in / proc/ bus/ usb. One way to do this is to create a short script (/ etc/ hotplug/ usb/ consoleUserPerms) that changes the ownership and permissions, as shown below:
The usermap file that goes with this is / etc/ hotplug/ usb/ logitechmouse. usermap, as shown below:

Working as a root user is a potentially dangerous situation. While unlikely, it is entirely possible to do permanent damage to your system while working as root.
To delete a screen saver, type the following commands:
bash$ cd $KDEDIR/ kde4/ services/ ScreenSavers bash$ ls
bash$ cd $KDEDIR/ share/ kde4/ services/ ScreenSavers bash$ mv krandom. desktop krandom. backup
You must close the & systemsettings; entirely and restart it before the changes will be seen.
bash$ cd $KDEDIR/ share/ kde4/ services/ ScreenSavers bash$ mv krandom. backup krandom. desktop
Restart the & systemsettings;, and the screen saver is back in the list.
Advanced Settings: Grace period
To alter the grace period setting, you need to manually edit the configuration file. To do so:
$cd ~/. kde/ share/ config
Now, using a text editor (the example uses & kate;, the & kde; text editor), load the kscreensaverrc.
$kate kscreensaverrc
Search through the file for an entry entitled LockGrace.
If the entry exists, you can edit the value of the entry.
LockGrace=3000
The value of the entity represents the duration of the grace period in milliseconds. An entry of 3000, would change the grace period to 3 seconds. You can set the value of the entry to any number between zero (no grace period) and 300000 (5 minutes).
Any changes to the configuration entry take effect immediately.

KSnapshot

screen grab
Introduction
Using & ksnapshot;
This chapter describes the use of & ksnapshot; for capturing screen images.
Starting & ksnapshot;
You may start & ksnapshot; by selecting it from the K-Menu Applications Graphics Screen Capture Program & ksnapshot;.
You may start & ksnapshot; by entering the following at the command prompt:
% ksnapshot &
The mini command line & krunner; (invoked with Alt; F2) may also be used to start & ksnapshot;
Once & ksnapshot; starts, you will see a window like the following:
& ksnapshot; Preview Window
To take a snapshot of a single window, select the Window Under Cursor combo box entry (next to the Capture mode label), and then click on the New Snapshot button.
With No delay, the snapshot is taken immediately when you click into a window.
Additional Features
Snapshot Delay
Include window decorations is enabled by default in Window Under Cursor mode.
Buttons
There are two further buttons located at the bottom of the & ksnapshot; window. Their function is described below.
Help
Quit
Quits the & ksnapshot; application.
& DBus; Interface
& ksnapshot; can be scripted using its & DBus; interface. This chapter explains the various & DBus; calls that you can use, and provides some examples of how you can use them.
As with all & DBus; calls, you need to specify the application you want to interface with, and the particular interface. With & ksnapshot; you need to identify which particular application, which is ksnapshot- followed by the process number.
To start & ksnapshot; and obtain the right argument, use dcopstart ksnapshot, which returns the argument (such as ksnapshot-20594) on standard output.
$dcop ` dcopstart ksnapshot ` interface QCStringList interfaces() QCStringList functions() QString url() void slotGrab() void slotPrint() void slotSave() bool save(QString filename) void slotSaveAs() void slotCopy() void setTime(int newTime) int timeout() void setURL(QString newURL) void setGrabMode(int grab) int grabMode() void slotMovePointer(int x, int y) void exit()
In the examples following, the process is always ksnapshot-23151.
You can obtain the current capture mode using grabMode, as shown below: $dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface grabMode This will return 0 for full-screen capture, 1 for window capture, and 2 for region capture.
You can set the capture mode using setGrabMode, which requires an argument to identify the mode required (as for grabMode). So you can set window capture mode (1), using:
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface setGrabMode 1
You can obtain the current timeout setting (the Snapshot delay: & GUI; item) using timeout, as shown below: $dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface timeout This will return the timeout setting in seconds, or zero if there is no delay (capture on click).
You can set the timeout using setTime, which requires an argument to identify the timeout duration. So you can set a delay of 4 seconds using:
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface setTime 4
You can obtain the path that the snapshot will be saved to using url, as shown below: $dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface url This will return the filename, as a & URL; (eg as file: / // home/ bradh/ test2. png).
You can set the path using setURL, which requires a string argument to identify the new path. So you can set the path to file: / // home/ bradh/ snapshot. jpg using:
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface setURL file: / // home/ bradh/ snapshot. jpg
The key to taking screenshots with & DCOP; is use of slotGrab, as shown below:
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface slotGrab
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface slotSave
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface slotCopy
If you need to select a window that may not be under the mouse cursor, you can use slotMovePointer, passing the x position (in screen pixels) and the y position (also in screen pixels) as arguments. So to move the mouse to the top left hand corner of the screen (0,0), you can do the following:
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface slotMoveMouse 0 0
You can print the current screenshot (which may or may not have been saved) using printSlot, as shown below:
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface slotPrint
& DCOP; Application control
$dcop ksnapshot-23151 interface exit

Introduction
Before starting...
What is & kopete;?
For more info about the & kopete; project; the team maintains a website at & kopetewww;. The latest news and updates are always available there.
If you need to contact the team, the & kopete; developers' mailing list is hosted at https: / /mail. kde. org/ mailman/ listinfo/ kopete-devel.
Getting Started
The messaging services that & kopete; supports that are based on open standards are Jabber and IRC.
The following section assumes you are registered with an & im; service already. If not, you can register with Gadu-Gadu, Jabber, and MSN from inside & kopete;; for other services, you'll have to register using their respective web site before creating an account in & kopete;.
Creating Accounts
To create an account, use Settings Configure... to display the Configure window.
The Configure window is the main way to set up and customize & kopete;. On the left a column of icons control which aspect of & kopete; is being configured. Click the Accounts icon. The main pane will change to display the account management pane. This is currently empty, but will soon list your & im; accounts. Click New to display the Account Wizard.
The Account Wizard helps you create an & im; account. After the Introduction page, you are asked to select the messaging service that you'd like to use. Click one of the services shown and then click Next. On the following page, you should enter your registration details for that instant messaging service.
Remember password
Now you'll notice that an icon representing the account has appeared in the status bar at the bottom of the & kopete; Contact List window. This represents your current presence for this account. Right click on it and you can go online from the menu that appears. The status bar icon will animate while & kopete; connects to the & im; service.
If you've just created a new account you wo n't have any contacts. See Adding Contacts for details on how to add contacts.
The shortcut for Send is set to Ctrl; Enter; by default; you can change it in the Chat window using Settings Configure Shortcuts....
Using & kopete;
The Contact List appears when you start & kopete;. It's the main window where you can set your presence, start a chat, organize your contacts, configure & kopete; and quit.
Menu
Tool bar
The toolbar holds the most frequently used & kopete; actions. You can customize it with Settings Configure Toolbars.... Notice the Show Offline Users and Show Empty Groups buttons. With these you can hide contacts and groups that are offline.
& kopete; makes it even easier to set a status message to let your contacts know about your mood or why you're busy at the moment. Click on the Set Status Message button and start typing to enter a new message, or choose from one of the previous messages you have used.
Contact List
Status bar
To start a chat from the Contact List, simply click a contact. A Chat window will appear.
You can also right click a contact and select either Send Message or Start Chat. Send Message works differently in that it just sends a single message without opening the Chat window, using a simple dialog. Use it for fire-and-forget messages.
Organizing Contacts
One of the principles behind & kopete; is that it offers a standardized way to use & im; systems. Differences between & im; systems are smoothed over, making it easier to communicate. We follow this principle in the way contacts are organized. When you use & kopete; you just find contacts by name; the actual & im; system used is less important. Some people have more than one & im; account - & kopete; puts the person using the account first.
Adding Contacts
To add a contact, either select File Add Contact or click the Add button on the toolbar. This brings up the Add Contact Wizard.
Welcome Page. Here you can choose whether you want to use the & kde; Address Book for this contact. Storing & im; information in the & kde; Address Book will enable other & kde; & im; programs to share contact information with & kopete; and in future & kde; applications may use & kopete; to send information via & im;. If you prefer to keep your & im; contacts separated, clear the check box here.
Choose & kde; Address Book entry. By choosing an entry from your & kde; Address Book, you can use its name as a Display Name in & kopete;. You can also create a new entry here. This page does n't show if you chose not to use the & kde; Address Book.
Select Display Name and Group. Here you can enter a Display Name (the name used for this person inside & kopete;), and choose the groups they are a member of.
Select & im; Accounts. Here you can choose which accounts you want to use to chat to the new contact. If you only have one & im; account, you wo n't see this screen.
Account-specific Add Contact Pages. For each account, you'll get one page where you can enter the UIN, buddy name or Email address, depending on the & im; system in use.
Finish Screen. All done. Except if the & im; system requires authorization (such as ICQ) to add a contact to your list - in which case, you'll be prompted after the wizard exits.
Renaming Contacts
Removing Contacts
You can change the metacontact a contact belongs to. In practice, you only have to do this when you have just added multiple accounts to & kopete;, and you know that HotDog76 and mikejones@hotmail. com are both the same person.
There are two ways to do this:
Drag and Drop
Configure & kopete;
You can configure & kopete; using Settings Configure.... See the next chapter for details.
Exiting & kopete;
To exit & kopete; you should use File Quit, Ctrl; Q, or the & kopete; System Tray icon's context menu. If you just close the Contact List window, & kopete; will continue to run in the & kde; System Tray.
Keyboard shortcuts
The following keyboard shortcuts are supported in the Contact List window:
Keyboard Shortcut
Action
Up Arrow
Select the previous item in the contact list.
Down Arrow
Select the next item in the contact list.
Left Arrow
Close the current group.
Right Arrow
Open the current group.
Enter
Start a chat with the selected contact.
& Ctrl; M
Show/ Hide the menu bar.
& Ctrl; U
Show/ Hide offline users.
& Ctrl; G
Show/ Hide empty groups.
You can control the appearance of the Chat View, making it look like other & im; clients or create a completely individual look.
Input Area
By default, the keyboard shortcut to send messages is & Enter;.
Status Bar
Tabbing
Red
Someone typed a message.
Green
Someone is typing a message.
Blue
Someone typed a message containing your nickname.
You can use & kopete; to chat one to one, or in a group, where the & im; system supports this.
File Transfers
Keyboard Shortcuts
The following keyboard shortcuts are supported in the Chat window:
& Enter;
Send the message in the Input Area.
& Ctrl; P
Print the contents of the Chat View.
& Ctrl; S
Save the contents of the Chat View.
& Ctrl; W
Close the current Chat View. The Chat window will close unless there is more than one tab in the window.
& Ctrl;,
Change to the previous tab.
& Ctrl;.
Change to the next tab.
& Ctrl; Shift; B
Tab
Configuring & kopete;
To configure & kopete;, look in the Settings menu.
Global Shortcuts
& kopete; defines some shortcuts which are valid in any & kde; application.
& Ctrl; Shift; I
Read Message. This is useful if you have hidden the Contact List window and the system tray icon is animating to tell you you have a new message.
& Ctrl; Shift; C
Show/ hide (Dock) the Contact List window. Warning: If you have disabled & kopete; 's System Tray icon or do n't have a system tray, this can make the Contact List vanish - the only way to restore it is to repeat this shortcut.
Adding and Editing Accounts
We briefly showed you how to add an account in Getting Started. To change an account's settings later, open up the Configure & kopete; dialog, with Settings Configure.... Much like the & kde; Control Center, the configuration is separated into sections. The icons on the left side of the dialog switch between sections.
On the Accounts page, you can Add, Remove, or Modify accounts. Editing accounts is much the same as adding them, but note that you cannot change the UIN, buddy name, or whatever account identifier your & im; system uses. This is intrinsic to the account. If you want to change this, you will have to add another account with the new account identifier and (optionally) remove the old account.
Global Identity
Behavior
Behavior covers the way & kopete; integrates with your desktop, Away settings, and chat user interface options.
By default, & kopete; places an icon in the & kde; System Tray. If you prefer, you can turn this off here.
This causes & kopete; to start with the Contact List window hidden (docked). You can make it visible by clicking the system tray icon or with the Show Contact List global shortcut.
New messages open chat windows as soon as they arrive.
Notifications
Enable events while away
Configure Sounds & Events
OhReally at the & kde; Forum suggests having your online notifications read out by a speech synthesizer, using MBROLA like so:
echo %s _BAR_ sed -e's/ online/ onlaain/ i '_BAR_ / usr/ local/ bin/ mbrdico. dutch. female
Away Settings
Auto Away
Chat Settings
Some & im; systems can give extra information, like people joining or leaving chats. This option lets you receive these messages in your chat window.
This simply emphasizes messages in a chat that contain your nickname. For more powerful control over highlighting and other events, see the Highlight plugin.
Interface Preference
Appearance
Emoticons
On this tab, you can select which emoticon set you prefer, or turn off graphical emoticons altogether.
See Specialized Actions for details of how to install extra emoticon sets.
Chat Window
Styles
Third party styles are available at http: / /kde-look. org. & kopete; 0.12 now supports styles from Adium(an & im; program on & Mac; OS X). So you can download styles from Adium here: Adium Xtras and select Message View Styles.
To install a style, click Install.... Select an archive file containing the style. To delete a style, select a style in the list and click Delete.
By disabling this, & kopete; 's groups are hidden, and contacts are divided only into Online Contacts and Offline Contacts.
Usually & kopete; displays contacts and groups as a tree, where group members are indented. For a simpler appearance, you can disable this, so the contact list becomes a flat list. You can also control whether branches are indented here.
There are several ways you can present the contact list here. Of particular interest may be the Use contact photos when available option, that shows the contact list using photos chosen by your contacts or the & kde; Address Book
This controls the degree of animation of the contact list. Turning this off will make & kopete; more responsive on slower machines.
Colors and Fonts
Formatting Overrides
Devices
Video
& kopete; uses the Video4Linux 2 system for video. This shows a blue square if no video device is found, or a preview if the camera is working. For up-to-date information on & kopete; webcam support, see the Kopete Webcam Support wiki page.
Audio
Audio support in & kopete; is at an experimental stage. If you have an Audio tab, you are probably using a preview build of & kopete;.
Loading Plugins
You can customize & kopete; with special functions that may be useful or just a bit of fun. Bring up the Configure Plugins dialog with Settings Configure Plugins....
Plugins can be turned on or off in the list on the left side of the page. Each plugin may be configured on the right side. See the chapter on plugins for details on each plugin.

Web Presence
Example: sftp: / /username@somehost. org/ path/ to/ homes/ user/ im. html uses the SFTP protocol to upload your presence directly onto the webserver.
See the KIO manuals for tips on specific network protocols.
& kopete; 's name comes from the chilean word Copete, meaning a drink with your friends. Duncan, the original author, recorded an audio sample.
MSN, ICQ, AIM, Jabber, and Yahoo use the & kde; network infrastructure. Their SOCKS proxy details are configured with the rest of & kde;, in Control Center, Internet & Network Proxy.
To install new emoticons, first look at KDE-Look. org, where there are a lot of additional emoticon sets to download.
The emoticons are easy to install - you just place a folder containing the icon files along with an & XML; file describing the mapping from text to picture in $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ kopete/ pics/ emoticons (or $KDEHOME, for example, in / home/ joeuser/. kde/).
Copy the extracted folder to $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ kopete/ pics/ emoticons or $HOME/. kde/ share/ apps/ kopete/ pics/ emoticons (or wherever $KDEHOME is)

Support highlight
Your style must show highlight. In Kopete and Adium, the %textbackgroundcolor{}% is replaced with the highlight color. Add this style attribute: background-color: %textbackgroundcolor{}% to the HTML element that display the message.
Consecutive message templates are required.
This guideline is for people rewriting old XSL styles to the new format. All styles must supply a template for consecutive messages. It is now a default feature.
The title said it all. You must save your files to UTF-8.
Supply Contents/ Info. plist for interopability with Adium
The Contents/ Info. plist file is not used in Kopete yet. But if you want your style to be compatible with Adium, you must supply that file. Here a basic example file. Strings to replace are enclosed with "$".

Supply buddy_icon. png
You must place a file named buddy_icon. png in the Incoming and Outgoing. These images will be used when the contact have no photo.

& akregator; is a program to read RSS and other online news feeds.
KDE
Akregator
Introduction
What is & akregator;?
& akregator; is a & kde; application for reading online news feeds. It has a powerful, user-friendly interface for reading feeds and the management of them.
RSS and Atom feeds
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an & XML; -based format used for publishing news or articles in a machine-readable form. An RSS or Atom file is also called a feed. A program that can be used to read such feeds is called a feed reader or aggregator, hence the title of the application, & akregator;.
RSS is available in different versions which are not compatible with each other (this situation caused by competing companies): RSS 0.9, RSS 1.0 and RSS 2.0. Atom is also an & XML; -based feed language which has been redesigned to fit the needs of webloggers and news sites. Atom attempts to replace RSS feeds and remove the uncertainty with incompatiblities in the different RSS versions.
When you first start & akregator;, you see its main window:
akregator; main window
akregator; main window
Go to the menu Feed and choose Add Feed... or use the default keyboard shortcut (Insert). The following dialog appears, with an input line labeled Feed URL:.
Enter www. slashdot. org or http: / /www. slashdot. org in the line edit next to Feed URL and click OK.
The feed settings dialog appears and you can modify the default options. When you are happy with the feed settings, click OK again.
Now Slashdot has been added to your feed list.
Select the parent folder of the new folder. In this example, we select All Feeds.
Open Feed New Folder.... Enter News (or a more appropriate name for the feed category) in the line edit and choose OK.
Now you can drag the Slashdot feed to the new folder.
Configuring & akregator;
General
The General tab contains the basic and otherwise-uncategorizable options of & akregator;.
Global
Display the & akregator; icon in the systray.
Fetch feeds every:
This is enabled when Use interval fetching is checked. You can specify a time interval, after which feeds are checked for new articles. Default is 30 minutes.
Startup
When enabled, & akregator; marks all articles as read when started.
When enabled, & akregator; fetches all feeds right after start.
Network
When enabled, the & kde; -wide browser cache settings are used when updating feeds. You can configure the & kde; -wide browser cache either in & kcontrolcenter; or in & konqueror; configuration dialog.
Archive
All articles are kept forever.
Limit feed archive size to:
If the number of articles exceeds the chosen limit, the oldest articles are deleted. Note that flagged articles are ignored when counting the number of articles: if your limit is 500, and you have 510 unflagged and 50 flagged articles, & akregator; will ignore the 50 flagged ones and only delete the 10 oldest unflagged articles. So in this example, 550 articles would be kept.
Delete articles older than:
Disable archiving
No articles are stored - all articles are discarded when quitting & akregator;.

Underline links
Check this if you want links to be underlined by default.

You can use another web browser for & akregator; other than your & kde; default. If you wish to do so, check this option and enter the command for the browser, provided it is in your $PATH.

scheduler
Introduction
In its default graphical mode, & kalarm; displays the list of pending alarms, showing their times and details. You can create new alarms, or you can select existing alarms for modification or deletion. You can also optionally view expired alarms.
Alarms may also be scheduled from the command line, or via D-Bus calls from programs.
Alarm message
When the alarm specifies a command to execute or an email to send, & kalarm; displays nothing.
Using & kalarm;
All spin boxes in & kalarm; have an acceleration facility. To make the value change by larger steps, hold down the & Shift; key while you click on the spin arrow buttons.
Alarm Types
Alarm List
Main window
You can optionally show the remaining time until each alarm is due, together with, or instead of, the alarm's scheduled time. To show or hide the alarm time column, select View Show Alarm Times. To show or hide the time-to-alarm column, select View Show Time To Alarms. At least one of these columns is always shown.
Archived Alarms
You can search through the alarm list to find alarms containing a search text. To invoke this, select Edit Find.... In the search dialog, select the alarm types which you wish to search. To continue searching for more alarms which match, use Edit Find Next or Edit Find Previous.
Text message alarms: the message text is searched.
File display alarms: the file path/ URL; is searched.
Command alarms: the command line or command script is searched.
Email alarms: in addition to the subject and body of the email, the recipients and the URLs of attachments are searched.
Audio alarms: the file path/ URL; is searched.
Creating and Manipulating Alarms
Right click on the system tray icon and choose New Alarm from the context menu.
Right click in the alarm list and choose New from the context menu.
To create a new alarm which displays an existing email message, drag the email from & kmail; onto & kalarm; 's main window or system tray icon. This opens the Alarm Edit dialog with the entire email message (including sender, recipient, & etc;) as the alarm text.
To create a new email alarm to send a copy of an existing email message, drag the email from & kmail; onto & kalarm; 's main window or system tray icon. Then select the Email option. The Alarm Edit dialog is preset with the entire email message except sender.
To create a new alarm which displays a summary of an existing to-do, drag the to-do from & korganizer; or other application onto & kalarm; 's main window or system tray icon. This opens the Alarm Edit dialog with the to-do contents as the alarm text.
To create a file display alarm, drag a text or image file & URL; onto & kalarm; 's main window or system tray icon. This opens the Alarm Edit dialog and sets the file name.
To create an audio alarm, drag an audio file & URL; onto & kalarm; 's main window or system tray icon. This opens the Alarm Edit dialog and sets the file name.

Select one or more appropriate archived alarms by clicking on their entries in the alarm list. Then choose Actions Reactivate.
Right click on the desired entries in the archived alarm list and choose Reactivate from the context menu.
Enabling/ Disabling an Alarm
See Enabling and Disabling Alarms for how to enable and disable alarms, either individually or as a whole.
See Alarm Message Window for how to acknowledge alarms.
Alarm Templates
If you frequently want to set up similar alarms, you can create an alarm template to avoid having to enter all the details from scratch each time. A template can contain all the details which an alarm can contain, apart from the start date.
Select the File New From Template menu item, and then select the desired template.
Right click on the system tray icon and choose New Alarm From Template from the context menu. Then select the desired template.
Configuring Templates
Display the Alarm Templates dialog by selecting the File Templates... menu item, clicking New, and choosing the alarm type from the list which appears. This displays a blank Template Edit dialog.
To modify an existing template, display the Alarm Templates dialog by selecting the File Templates... menu item and click Edit. This displays the Template Edit dialog which is described below.
To delete existing templates, display the Alarm Templates dialog by selecting the File Templates... menu item, select one or more templates and click Delete. A confirmation prompt is issued to prevent accidental deletions.
The Template Edit dialog is similar to the Alarm Edit dialog. The following controls are different:
In the Time group box, select one of:
Check Time to enter a time when the alarm is to be triggered.
Check Date only to specify that the alarm should only have a date, not a time.
Check Time from now to enter how long (in hours and minutes) after the alarm is created, that it should be triggered.
In the Recurrence Rule group box in the Recurrence tab, no day or month need be selected for weekly or yearly recurrences, respectively.

Specify whether or how the alarm should be repeated using the Recurrence tab.
The alarm's basic repetition characteristics are displayed for convenience in the title of the Recurrence tab. The recurrence interval is shown first, followed by any sub-repetition interval set up using the Sub-Repetition button.
To trigger the alarm once only, select No recurrence.
For a monthly recurrence, you may select either a fixed date, or a position (eg; the second Tuesday).
None: the alarm will occur on February 29th in leap years, but will be suppressed in non-leap years.
28 Feb: the alarm will occur on February 29th in leap years, and on February 28th in non-leap years.
1 Mar: the alarm will occur on February 29th in leap years, and on March 1st in non-leap years.
Select No end to continue the repetitions indefinitely.
Select End after to specify the total number of occurrences of the alarm.

Thanks go to the author of the & kde; 1 KAlarm application, Stefan Nikolaus stefan. nikolaus@stuco. uni-oldenburg. de, who kindly agreed to allow the name & kalarm; to be used by this application, which has been available for & kde; 2 onwards.
Installation
& install. intro. documentation;
& kalarm; is available for & kde; 2 and as standalone packages for & kde; 3 and & kde; 4 from http: / /www. astrojar. org. uk/ kalarm
Requirements
& kalarm; requires the standard & kde; libraries to be installed (the kdelibs and kdepimlibs packages), plus the kdebase/ runtime package. To compile from source, you also need the relevant library development packages, and the & Qt; development package.
& kalarm; uses about 12 Mb of memory to run, but this may vary depending on your platform and configuration.
You can find a list of changes in the Changelog file, or at http: / /www. astrojar. org. uk/ kalarm.
Compilation and Installation
If you cannot obtain a suitable precompiled binary package, you need to compile & kalarm; yourself from source files. Get the source package file kdepim-x. x. tar. bz2 or kalarm-x. x. tar. bz2 (or similar), depending on whether you want to install & package; or just & kalarm;. Unpack it in a new folder using a command similar to tar xvfj package. tar. bz2, and change to the folder which has been created.
& install. compile. documentation;
If you have more than one version of & kde; installed (e. g. & kde; 2 and & kde; 3), this may possibly install & kalarm; into the wrong & kde; folder. If necessary, you can give the & kde; folder as a parameter to. / configure. For example, if your & kde; is installed in / opt/ kde2:
. / configure --prefix= / opt/ kde2
For example, if & kde; is installed in / opt/ kde, KDEDIRS might normally be set to / etc/ opt/ kde: / opt/ kde. If you install & kalarm; into / usr/ local, you would need to set KDEDIRS to / usr/ local: / etc/ opt/ kde: / opt/ kde before starting & kde;.
. / configure --enable-doc-language= "fr en_GB"
Configuration
To run & kalarm; on a non-kde; desktop, the main requirement is to ensure that & kalarm; is run automatically whenever you log in. More detailed instructions are contained in the INSTALL file which is distributed with & kalarm;.
Select one or more alarms by clicking on their entries in the alarm list. Then choose Actions Delete.
Alarm Resources
Click the Middle mouse button on the system tray icon.
Viewing an Alarm
To view an existing alarm without the ability to modify it, do one of the following:
Select it by clicking on its entry in the alarm list. Then choose Actions View.
Right click on its entry in the alarm list and choose View from the context menu.
This displays the Alarm Edit dialog in read-only mode.
Disables monitoring of alarms. This option only appears if alarms are currently enabled.
The Alarm Edit dialog enables you to view and edit an alarm.
Font & Color
Add color...: Displays a color selection dialog which lets you choose a color to add to the list.
& kalarm; uses the & arts; sound server for repetition and volume control. If & kalarm; has been built without & arts; support, repetition and volume options will not be available and a simple sound file selector will appear in place of the full Sound File dialog.
trigger or cancel an already scheduled alarm.
Specifies the unique ID of the event to be displayed/ executed or canceled.
handleEvent() is a & DCOP; call to display/ execute or cancel the specified alarm. & kalarm; retrieves the alarm from the calendar and then determines what action to take depending on when the alarm is due.
If the alarm is not yet due, nothing happens.
Cancel the alarm with the specified event ID.
--cancelEvent, --triggerEvent and --handleEvent are mutually exclusive.
What is the application name of & kalarm;?
When & kalarm; starts in graphical mode, it checks whether the alarm daemon is running. If it is not already running, & kalarm; starts it.
This option is only available if the run mode is continuous. (See Configuring & kalarm; for a description of run modes.)
To remove & kalarm; from the system tray, do one of the following:
Select View Hide from System Tray.
Right click on the system tray icon and choose Quit from the context menu.
& kalarm; retriggers missed alarms by resetting the alarm daemon, which is discussed in the Alarm Daemon section.
The alarm daemon is started if necessary and alarms will be monitored for when they become due.
Select Settings Control Alarm Daemon.... This displays the Service Manager dialog which enables you to stop the alarm daemon.
Disable alarms while not running: Selecting this option has the effect that alarms will be disabled whenever & kalarm; 's system tray icon is not visible.
Autostart system tray icon at login: In on-demand mode, this displays & kalarm; 's system tray icon at login. & kalarm; will run until the system tray icon is closed.
control the alarm daemon
--reset
Reset the alarm daemon.
Alarm Daemon
Starting the Alarm Daemon
Resetting the Alarm Daemon
Resetting starts the alarm daemon if it is not currently running.
Stopping the Alarm Daemon
Stopping the alarm daemon will prevent any further monitoring of scheduled alarm messages until the daemon is restarted.
To stop the alarm daemon, type the following command:
& David. Jarvie; & David. Jarvie. mail;
Command to enter a command to execute.
Show resources: This option determines whether the list of alarm resources is shown when & kalarm; starts up. (Once & kalarm; has started, use the View menu to show or hide the resource list.)
Show alarm time: Select this option to show the date and time at which each alarm is next scheduled.
Select Actions Alarms Enabled.
Right click on the system tray icon and choose Alarms Enabled from the context menu.
Specifies the & URL; (not path) of the calendar file containing the event to be triggered.
Specifies the unique ID of the event to be triggered, as stored in calendarFile.

Configure & kmail;
General Information
& kmail; 's configuration window enables you to configure & kmail; in many ways. You can reach it via Settings Configure & kmail;....
The dialog has several buttons:
Help
This will open this manual at the appropriate page.
Defaults
Load Profile...
Reset
OK
This saves the settings and closes the configuration dialog.
Apply
This saves the settings without closing the configuration dialog.
Cancel
Identities Page
You can find a quick introduction to the Identities page in the Getting Started section.
To add a new identity to the identity list, click on the New... button. The New identity dialog will then appear.
The New Identity Dialog
All fields of the new identity are cleared or preset with standard values.
Uses the settings of the Control Center's default email profile (you can edit that one under Internet & Network Email in the Control Center).
General
Your name
Enter your full name here (sometimes also called display name). Although this field is not strictly mandatory, it is recommended to enter the correct value here.
Organization
Enter your organization here. This field is optional.
Email address
Enter your email address here, & ie; something like joe@example. com.
Example
So if your address is Joe User & lt; joe@example. comgt;, you should enter Joe User into the Your name field and joe@example. com into the Email address field.
Cryptography
The Cryptography tab allows you to specify & openpgp; and & smime; keys associated with this identity, as well as choosing the preferred (cryptographic) message format to use.
OpenPGP signing key
To clear the label press the Clear button.
To change the selected key, press the Change... button. A dialog listing all secret & openpgp; keys will be shown allowing you to select the one to use.
OpenPGP encryption key
Here you can select the key to & openpgp; -encrypt messages to when this identity and are in effect. This key is also used for the function of the Composer.
To change the selected key, press the Change... button. A dialog listing all & openpgp; keys found in your keyring will be shown allowing you to select the one to use.
& smime; signing certificate
To change the selected certificate, press the Change... button. A dialog listing all secret & smime; signing certificates will be shown allowing you to select the one to use.
& smime; encryption certificate
Here you can select the certificate to & smime; -encrypt messages to when this identity and are in effect.
Preferred crypto message format
Advanced
Reply-To address
BCC address
Sent-mail folder
Drafts folder
Special transport
Select or enter an alternative SMTP server to be used when sending messages using this identity.
You need to configure outgoing mail servers first, before you can choose them from the list. You can do this on the Sending tab of the Accounts page.
Signature
& kmail; can also read the signature text from the output of a command. Thus, you can use programs such as fortune to create a new signature text for every message. Everything the program prints onto stdout is caught and used as the signature text.
Accounts Page
Sending
The Sending tab allows you to define new outgoing mail servers and set some common options.
For basic information, see Setting up your Account: Sending.
Never Automatically
Even with Allow 8-bit selected & kmail; will use MIME Compliant encoding in some situations, for example for sending cryptographically signed messages.
Receiving
For basic information, see Setting up your Account: Receiving.

Headers
With Message header threading options you can select whether threads should appear expanded (open) by default or whether they should be collapsed (closed). You can of course still open/ close threads using the + / - buttons.

Composer Page
If checked, will default to on. Check this option only if you know what you are doing. & mdn; s are considered a nuisance (or are simply ignored) by a lot of people. It is better to decide to request them on a message-by-message basis.
Autosave interval
External Editor

Subject
Charset
The Define custom mime header fields list sets the headers that & kmail; will use for its outgoing messages. You can both invent new fields and overwrite existing ones. This feature is only useful for advanced users.

Reading
Prefer HTML to plain text
The following options (listed as Send policy) are available to control when & kmail; sends & mdn; s:
Ignore (recommended)
Ask
Deny
Always send
Nothing
Full message
Only headers
If unsure, leave the option checked.
Verifying & smime; signatures always involves importing the contained certificates. This option thus does not affect this. It is also unrelated to & gpg; 's auto-key-retrieve feature, where & gpg; will try to import unknown keys from a key server.
Composing
On this tab you can configure security-relevant options for composing messages.
& kmail; supports this mode half-heartedly, since such functionality should better placed at the mail server (MTA) than at the mail client (MUA) level. Thus, future versions of & kmail; may drop support for this option.
Also called opportunistic encryption. If checked, & kmail; will try to match recipients to (openpgp; or & smime;) keys even when you did not specifically request encryption. If usable keys are found for all recipients, & kmail; will ask whether or not you want to encrypt the message.
Warnings
While it is common to sign all outgoing messages, encrypting them is not. So unless your company has a policy of never sending any unencrypted messages, it might be a good idea to keep this option switched off and rely on opportunistic encryption to alert you if you could send encrypted messages, but did not request it.
Warn if certificates/ keys expire soon
If checked, & kmail; will warn when an & smime; certificate or & openpgp; key is used which will expire soon.
Re-Enable All & quot; Donapos; t Ask Againquot; Warnings
& smime; Validation
Validate certificates using CRLs
Validate certificates online (OCSP)
If this option is selected, & smime; certificates are validated using the Online Certificates Status Protocol (OCSP).
OCSP responder URL
OCSP responder signature
Select or change and enter the & smime; key to use.
Ignore service URL of certificates
Check this option to skip online validation using the OCSP. This Option requires dirmngr & gt; = 0.9.0.
By default, GnuPG uses the file ~/. gnupg/ policies. txt to check if a certificate policy is allowed. If this option is selected, policies are not checked.
Never consult a CRLs
Do not perform any HTTP requests
Entirely disables the use of HTTP for smime;.
Ignore HTTP CRL Distribution Point of certificates
When looking for the location of a CRL, the "to-be-tested" certificate usually contains what are known as CRL Distribution Point (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.
Use system HTTP proxy
Enter here the location of your HTTP Proxy, which will be used for all HTTP requests relating to smime;. The syntax is "host: port", for instance myproxy. nowhere. com:3128.
Do not perform any LDAP requests
Entirely disables the use of LDAP for smime;.
Ignore LDAP CRL Distribution Point of certificates
When looking for the location of a CRL, the "to-be-tested" certificate usually contains what are known as CRL Distribution Point (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the LDAP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ;)
Using PGP or GnuPG is very slow or it blocks & kmail;.
& kmail; accesses PGP / GnuPG synchronously, & ie; it blocks while PGP / GnuPG works. This means that you might want to disable automatic retrieval of unknown keys from a keyserver to make & kmail; look more responsive. If you are using GnuPG 1.0.7 (or better) or upgraded from an earlier version, then make sure to run gpg --rebuild-keydb-caches once and gpg --check-trustdb after every import or refresh. Both will speed up GnuPG immensely.
How can I convert my mailboxes from mbox to maildir?
Change the File Associations for HTML files using & kcontrol;.
To add a whole mbox mail folder use ln -s / somewhere/ Mail/. remotedir. directory / home/ username/ share/ apps/ kmail/. mymailboxfile. directory. Note that it is not possible to use links to files, only links that point to folders will work.
& kmail; does not display HTML mail properly.
Does & kmail; support uuencoded files?
Uuencoded attachments are supported, but inline uuencoded files are not.
My SMTP server requires authentication; Does & kmail; support this?
Can I use & kmail; and procmail?
Spellchecking does not recognize non-English characters.
How do I use my Eudora / Netscape; / Outlook /... mail folders in & kmail;?
Can I use encryption with my normal (non- SSL) POP3 account?
Modify your & kmail; configuration to fetch the mail via POP3 from localhost and ssh will tunnel the connection for you.
& kmail; does not lock the files in ~/ Mail.
Procmail lockfile
Mutt dotlock
Mutt dotlock privileged
FCNTL (default)
none (use with care)
FCNTL will use the fcntl() system call.
If you do not want to use any locking, the none option is what you want. However, there are risks of losing mail when no locking is used.
You can get a list of functions by using this command in a shell: dcop kmail KMailIface. Some documentation is also available in kdenetwork/ kmail/ kmailIface. h and kdenetwork/ kmail/ mailcomposerIface. h.

Getting Started
The Configure window consists of six sections: Identities, Network, Appearance, Composer, Security, and Misc.
The settings in the Identities page are fairly straightforward. Select your default identity and click Modify. Fill in the Your name field with your full name (eg; John Doe) and the Organization field (optional) with the appropriate information.
Next, fill in the Email address field with your email address (eg; john@example. net).
Sending Messages
Receiving Messages
select Disconnected IMAP when choosing your Account Type. Fill in the Login and Password fields with respectively your user email address and password on the Kolab server. In the Security section click on the Check What the Server Support button for automated set-up of your Security configuration. The default should be TLS/ PLAIN. The Kolab server supports SSL/ PLAIN as well. Those settings may of course be configured manually.
Options for both IMAP and POP3
& kmail; supports encryption via SSL and TLS (TLS should be preferred if it is available).
For POP3 & kmail; supports:
Clear text,
PLAIN,
LOGIN,
CRAM-MD5 (recommended if DIGEST-MD5 is not available),
DIGEST-MD5 (recommended) and
APOP authentication.

Using & kmail;
The main window is the window that appears when & kmail; is started. It is by default divided into three panes:
Keyboard Shortcuts
The following keyboard shortcuts are supported in the main window:
Keyboard Shortcut

Space
Right Arrow or N
Go to the next message in the current folder.
Left Arrow key or P
Go to the previous message in the current folder.

Shift; Left Arrow and Shift; Right Arrow
Select messages in the header pane, starting with the current message.
For more keyboard shortcuts have a look at the Settings Configure Shortcuts... dialog.
There are a variety of shortcuts to help you with writing your messages. The... buttons next to the To:, CC:, and BCC: fields will call up the address book so that you can select addresses from there.
Signing and Encrypting Messages
If you want to send an encrypted or digitally signed message, select the Sign Message or Encrypt Message icons in the toolbar. Moreover you can select the format that should be used to sign and/ or encrypt the message. Depending on the installed encryption programs you can choose between:
Any
Inline OpenPGP (deprecated)
This format is outdated. If you use this format then only the message text will be signed and/ or encrypted. Attachments will neither be signed nor encrypted. HTML messages cannot be signed with this format. You should only use this format if necessary, & ie; if you send messages to users of email clients that cannot handle the more advanced formats.
PGP/ MIME
This format is the successor of the inline OpenPGP format. If you use this format then the message text and all attachments will be signed and/ or encrypted (at least by default). This is the recommended format if you use OpenPGP.
S/ MIME
This format is an alternative format to PGP/ MIME. If you use this format then the message text and all attachments will be signed and/ or encrypted (at least by default). This format is mostly used by corporations.
S/ MIME opaque
This format is a variant of the S/ MIME format. It should only be used if necessary.
Creating HTML Messages
Note that HTML messages are often regarded as an annoyance; therefore, you should avoid sending HTML messages if possible. Particularly, you should never send HTML messages to a mailing list unless HTML messages are explicitly allowed.
Creating tables and embedding images is currently not possible.
Adding Attachments
Select one of the options in the Attach menu.
You can also attach public keys to the message by using the appropriate options in the Attach menu. PGP key attachments are handled like file attachments.
& kmail; will automatically check the spelling of your message (in HTML mode this currently does not work) and display unknown words using red color. If there are too many unknown words & kmail; will disable its checking. To select the language used for checking, select View Dictionary. You can disable automatic spellchecking in the Options menu.
To check the spelling of your message using a dialog, select Tools Spelling.... & kmail; uses sonnet; to check spelling, which is the & kde; frontend to the ispell or aspell spelling checker. Note that you may first need to configure the spellchecker using Settings Spellchecker....
Message Folders
Message Folders are used to organize your email messages. By default, if you have no existing message folders, messages are stored in the folder $KDEHOME / share/ apps/ kmail/. If you have existing message folders in ~/ Mail, these will be used instead. When you first start & kmail; the inbox, outbox, sent-mail, trash and drafts folders are created. These folders each have special functions:
Where & kmail; by default puts your new messages when you ask it to check your mail.
If you want to clear all of the messages out of a folder choose Folder Move All Messages to Trash. You can use Folder Delete Folder to remove a folder and all its messages and subfolders.
Folder Properties
General
Rename a folder by changing the entry in the Name: field.
See the Folder Format section for information about the Mailbox format.
With Show Sender/ Receiver you can set the visible columns in the header pane. This is useful if you use a folder to save your own sent messages.

Introduction
& korganizer; is an intuitive and easy to use personal information manager (PIM). You can schedule appointments, events, create to-dos and write journal entries. & korganizer; will remind you about pending tasks, record your occurrences, experiences, and reflections and help you keep your schedule.
Main features of & korganizer;:
Create To-dos, schedule events, and write journal entries.
Organize your events and to-dos by grouping the related items in categories.
Highlight categories with colors.
Open multiple calendars, and seamless view and edit them.
Reschedule your events by drag-and-drop.

Much more...
Five-minute Fly-over Course of & korganizer;
Entering Events
Click the Day View toolbar button or choose the View Day menu item. This will bring up the Day View.
Click on the desired date in the Date Navigator.
Enter event details. Use tabs General, Recurrence, Attendees, Free/ Busy and Attachments to move around the dialog and access all the event's characteristics.
Press OK to save the event.
Entering To-dos
Select the Actions New To-do... menu item to open the New To-do dialog.
Enter the to-do details. Use tabs General, Attendees, Recurrence and Attachments to move around the dialog.
Press OK to save the to-do.
Select the View Journal menu item to open the Journal main view.
Click the Add Journal Entry link.
Enter journal entry title and text.
Rescheduling Events
Rescheduling events is a simple drag-and-drop operation:
You should choose an appropriate view before beginning this operation. Only the agenda view (day, work week and week views) shows individual hours and are suitable for rescheduling exactly-timed events (appointments), while the Month view only shows days. Therefore the Month view is most suitable for long-time events like holidays.
To display the week view, press the Week View toolbar button, or choose the View Week menu item.
Drag and drop the event to the new date and time location.
Rescheduling or Editing To-dos
You should choose an appropriate view before beginning this operation. Only the list view, to-do list view and the to-do view sidebar component show to-dos which do not have a due date.
To edit a to-do, right click it and choose the Edit... menu item.
Conclusion
Importing, Exporting, and Managing Calendars
& korganizer; can store (and retrieve) events, journals entries and to-dos using various methods, and to different locations. Each of these locations is called a calendar resource.
Calendar Resources
Please note that & korganizer; group scheduling communication is based on a peer to peer email standard. This means that you do not need a groupware server to use it!
Adding a New & korganizer; Resource
If the resource view is not available on & korganizer; 's sidebar, choose the Settings Sidebar Show Resource View menu item to display it.
Press the Add... button to add new resources to the list of available resources.
Check or uncheck the resource box to enable or disable it.
Later, if you want to edit or delete a resource, select it on the list and press Delete to remove it or Edit... to modify it.
Alternatively, you can configure the & korganizer; resources (plus all other & kde; resources), in the & systemsettings;, using the kde; Resources configuration module.
Among the existing resources, you can find:
Birthdays from & kaddressbook;
Bugzilla To-do List
Add this resource to load bugzilla open bugs as to-dos. This resource is based on the & kbugbuster; application, and uses its bug cache information. Bugzilla is an open source bug tracking system.
& XML; Feature Plan
Add this resource to be able to save (and load) your events, to-dos and journal entries to a local file. The file can be in the iCalendar or in the vCalendar standard format. & korganizer; uses this resource by default, storing your calendar information under $KDEHOME/ share/ apps/ korganizer/ std. ics.
GroupDav Server (e. g. Open Groupware)
If you have access to a server that supports the GroupDav protocol, add this resource in order to be able to save (and load) events and to-dos to the server. To add the resource, you will need to know the server & URL;, your user name and your password. The GroupDav protocol supports the storage of contacts, so you may want to add and configure the & kaddressbook; resource too.
As of June 2005, the groupware servers that implement this protocol are the OpenGroupware server and the Citadel server. An up to date list can be obtained at the GroupDav website.
Novell Groupwise Server
If you have access to a Novell GroupWise Server (version 6.5 or later), add this resource in order to be able to save (and load) events, free/ busy information and to-dos to the server. To add the resource, you will need to know the server & URL;, your user name and your password. There is support for storage of contacts, so you may want to configure & kaddressbook; resource.
The most practical way to configure the access to a GroupWise server is to use the groupwisewizard wizard. You can start it from the command line prompt: $groupwisewizard The wizard will configure not only & korganizer; to use the GroupWise resources, but & kmail;, & kaddressbook; too.
Calendar on IMAP Server via & kmail;
$kolabwizard
SUSE & Linux; OpenExchange Server
If you have access to a SUSE & Linux; OpenExchange Server, version 4.1, add this resource in order to be able to save (and load) events, free/ busy information and to-dos to the server. To add the resource, you will need to know the server & URL;, your user name and your password. There is support for storage of contacts, so you may want to configure & kaddressbook; resource.
The most practical way to configure the access to an OpenExchange server is to use the sloxwizard wizard. You can start it from the command line prompt: $sloxwizard The wizard will configure not only & korganizer; to use the OpenExchange resources, but & kmail;, & kaddressbook; too.
eGroupware Server (via & XML; -RPC)
If you have access to a eGroupware Server, version 1.0, add this resource in order to be able to save (and load) events, free/ busy information and to-dos to the server. To add the resource, you will need to know the server & URL;, your user name and your password. There is support for storage of contacts, so you may want to configure & kaddressbook; resource.

Importing, Exporting and Maintaining Calendars
Importing Calendars
Exporting Calendars
To export all your active events, to-dos and journal entries (independent of to what resource they belong) as a new iCalendar file, choose the File Export iCalendar... menu item. To export the same data as a new vCalendar file choose the File Export vCalendar... menu item. The Save As dialog will pop up. Enter the file name and location for the new file to complete the export action.
Choose the File Export Export Web Page... menu item. You will get a window with three tabs: General, Events, and To-dos.
Specify the date range that you want published. Enter dates manually or use the Calendar Widget.
If you want to export to-dos, check the Export to-do list box.
Specify the web output file in the Output file field. If set another location, press the Browse Folders button to find it.
Events tab: specify if you want to include categories and attendees in the exported web page.
To-dos tab: specify if you want to list Due Dates, Categories, and Attendees.
Contemporary computers have ample storage space. However, if you synchronize your & korganizer; calendar with a limited-memory machine like the Palm device, you will find archiving useful. The performance of & korganizer; can also become worse when there are many events. To archive old items, follow the procedure below:
Choose the File Archive Old Entries....
Before uploading the events, make sure you have filtered out all unrelated data.
Views and Filters
& korganizer; Views
The & korganizer; window can be divided in two main areas: the main window and the sidebar. The main window displays the main views and the sidebar displays the date navigator, the to-do view, the item viewer and the resource view. To show or hide the sidebar components, check or uncheck the menu items under the Settings Sidebar submenu.
The to-do view sidebar component lists your to-dos, just like the To-do view. It is useful if you want to see your to-dos while using the other views.
The item viewer sidebar component shows details of the currently selected events, to-dos or journal entries.
Finally, the resource viewer sidebar component allow you to enable or disable the resources on the list, by checking or unchecking the resource box, and to manage your resources. For more information, please check.
This view displays events and to-dos in a simple format you can quickly read. All open to-dos will be displayed, but only the events from the days selected in the Date Navigator sidebar will be shown. Events and to-dos are displayed one per line.
Switch to the What's Next view by choosing the View What's Next menu item or pressing the What's Next button in the toolbar.
List View
Switch the display to the list view by choosing the View List menu item or pressing the List button in the toolbar.
Agenda View
Any event can be rescheduled with your mouse. Move the mouse pointer over the event, and drag it to a new time location. This also works in the Week and Work Week views. Events can be moved to other, presently non-visible dates. Move the mouse pointer over the event, and drag it to the date navigator.
There are a useful shortcut for adding events:
Day View
This view presents the agenda view for a single day.
Switch the display to the day view by choosing the View Day menu item or pressing the Day button in the toolbar.
Next X Days View
This view presents the agenda view for the next days, starting from today. You can change the number of days to be displayed in the korganizer; view configuration. The default value is 3.
Switch the display to the next days view by choosing the View Next X Days menu item, (X represents the number of days, usually 3).
Week View
The week view provides a view similar to the day view. Events for seven days are shown next to each other.
Switch the display to the week view by choosing the View Week menu item or pressing the Week button in the toolbar.
Month View
To help you organize your data, the color of the events may reflect their category, and its resource, depending on the korganizer; view configuration. Therefore, if you assign categories to events and different colors to categories, you can identify the type of event (or resource) by its color.
Switch the display to the month view by choosing the View Month menu item or pressing the Month button in the toolbar.
Timeline View
To-do List
When you choose New To-do..., a dialog will pop up, allowing you to enter all necessary information.
To-dos can also dragged around with the mouse to rearrange the hierarchy or to exchange to-dos with other calendar windows. You can also read an overview of all available drag-and-drop operations.
Journal View
Categories
To assign categories when editing or creating new events or to-dos, press the Select Categories... button in the General tab to open the Select Categories dialog. You can assign more than one category for each item.
Filters
To create, delete and edit filters, choose the Settings Manage View Filters... menu item to open the Edit Calendar Filters dialog. Using this dialog, you can create, delete and edit filters that will affect which items will be displayed by & korganizer;.
Filters are useful when exporting your calendar. If you use a filter, only the filtered (visible) items will be exported. Also, filters are more effective when the items are already classified and organized in categories, as you can easily create filters based on categories.
Searching
Choose the Edit Find menu item, press the Find button in the toolbar, or press the Ctrl; f shortcut to find items (events, to-dos or journal entries) according to title, description, and/ or categories. The find action will only search the specified fields.
The result of the Find operation is a list of events, journal entries and/ or to-dos with the specified keyword. The search list characteristics are the same as the List View.
This resulting list is active. You can double-click a line to display or edit the event or to-do details. Get more information about these details in and.
Entering Data
Events
Events are future or past appointments, like business meetings, personal anniversaries and cinema visits. An event can also take several days, like holidays.

Show Time As:
The duration of the event may be shown as Busy or Free in your schedule. Choose it from the Show Time As drop down box.
Enter a long description of the event in the large, untitled rectangle. You can write as many details as you wish here.

To-dos
To enter a new to-do, choose Actions New To-do.... A window with General, Recurrence, Attendees, and Attachments tabs appears.
Title
Enter short description of the to-do into the Title field. This description is the text shown on the & korganizer; To-do list.
Enter short description of the location where the to-do will take place.
The Due and Start boxes are not initially checked, as to-dos usually do not have a start and due date. Check one or both boxes and change these dates as desired. Enter the dates directly or use the Calendar Widget. Choose time from quarter hour intervals, or enter the desired time directly into the time fields. These fields are only available when Time associated is checked.
The date and time are initially unchecked, because to-dos do not have the character of a fixed event. Some of them do not need a due date at all. Most of them certainly do not need the exact time of fulfillment. If your to-do requires exact time, maybe it actually belongs to events.
Completed
Priority
Assign a priority to your to-do. This drop down menu offers priorities from one to nine, one being the highest. Initially to-dos are set to priority five (medium).
Check the Reminder box if & korganizer; should remind you about the to-do.
Details
Enter a long description of the to-do in the large rectangle.
You can assign several categories to a calendar item. Click the Select Categories button to open the Select Categories dialog. Check the category boxes to assign suitable categories to the to-do. You can also add a new category, modify a category or delete a category by pressing the button Edit Category.
Access
Choose Private or Confidential to keep the to-do private or confidential. Currently, this choice correctly sets the CLASS attribute of the events or to-dos to PUBLIC, PRIVATE or CONFIDENTIAL. However, if these settings are really used to restrict the access of the information depends on the client and / or groupware server implementation.
Some to-dos take place regularly. You can specify exact scheduling here.
This tab is configure in the same way as the Edit Event dialog's Recurrence tab. Please check for more information about setting the recurrence options.
Some to-dos may require more people. You can list those people here. Please check for more information.
Some to-dos require attachments. You can Add..., Edit..., Remove, and Show attachments. You can refer to the attachment by entering the path to the attachment or Internet address.
Required Fields
The Attendees tab may be left completely empty.
The Recurrence tab must only be filled if you checked the Enable Recurrence check box.
The Attachments tab may be left completely empty.
Group Scheduling
If you simply want to send an event, to-do or journal entry, choose the Schedule Publish Item Information... menu item, when the item is selected. Then a dialog appears, asking you the email addresses which will receive the event or to-do. The item will be sent by email, in the iCalendar format.
When you create an event or a to-do, and add attendees to it, you are acting as the event organizer. To add attendees, use the attendee tab, in the Edit Event, or Edit To-do dialog. In the agenda view, a little icon Organizer Icon is placed in the event, if you are the organizer of a group scheduling event.
To cancel an event or to-do you have to be the organizer. If you checked the Use Groupware Communication box in the korganizer; group scheduling configuration, just delete the item, and & korganizer; will ask you to send the cancellation. If not, simply select the item, and choose the Schedule Send Cancellation to Attendees menu item.
If you have an invitation in your & kmail; inbox you can either press Reject to ignore the request, or press Accept or Accept Cond.. The last two actions will insert the item to your calendar. In any case, & kmail; will send your response to the organizer automatically.
If for any reason you changed your mind, edit your status in the item's attendee tab. If you checked the Use Groupware Communication box in the korganizer; group scheduling configuration, & korganizer; will ask you to send an email updating your attendee status. If not, choose the Schedule Send Status Update menu item to send your status update.
Free Busy information
The free/ busy information represents an availability schedule. By presenting the intervals when one already has previous commitments, others can avoid arranging appointments for these periods. Note that only the times are published, not the events, reasons or attendees.
& korganizer; supports publishing and retrieving free/ busy information, either manually or automatically.
To email your free/ busy information, choose the Schedule Mail Free Busy Information... menu item. Enter the email addresses you want to send the information to in the dialog and press OK.
Groupware servers usually have a standard location for uploading your free busy information, so that other users can access your data, and you can access other user's free busy schedule. You can configure & korganizer; to upload and download free busy information automatically, using the Free Busy preferences, in the & korganizer; Configure dialog.
To upload your free/ busy information to the server set in & korganizer; preferences, choose the Schedule Upload Free Busy Information menu item.
Examples
Using the Date Navigator, go to the next Monday.
Choose the Actions New Event..., or select the area between 12 noon and end at 1 pm, and start typing the event title.
Enter a suitable title. It's important to choose the right brief description, because this is the only field that can be searched. We suggest that you enter Product launch event.
Enter the detailed event program into the largest rectangle area. For the sake of this simple example, enter Introduction, The Plan, Conclusion on three separate lines.
Check the Reminder check box. Set the reminder time to 15 minutes, just long enough to brew a cup of tea prior to the meeting start.
Click the Select Categories button.
Check Appointment in the Available Categories. Then click the OK button.
Click the Recurrence tab and check the Enable recurrence box.
Most work has been done for you automatically. & korganizer; defaults to recurring weekly. Also note that No ending date is chosen. This means that this event will be repeated each Monday (starting, of course, on Monday February 12, 2004) until the end of time (that is, until you delete it).
Since everything is all right here, click the Attendees tab.
In the Attendees tab you should do the following:
You will see that you are the organizer of the event. Click the New button to add the other attendees.
In the Name field, enter the email in the Name & #060; email#062; format. In our example, enter Joan Holden & #060; jholden@thiscompany. com#062;.
Choose Chair as the role.
In the Name field, enter Peter Krzinski & #060; pkrzinski@thiscompany. com#062;.
In the Name field, enter Kirsten Friese & #060; kfriese@thiscompany. com#062;.
Review the event setup by clicking on the General, Attendees, and Recurrence tabs. If you are satisfied, click OK.

Plugins
Toolbars Configuration
You can right click the toolbar to bring up the Toolbar Menu. The icon size and text position can also be adjusted from this menu.
You can simply drag the toolbar by the handle on the left border of each toolbar, and drop it whenever you wish. Also look at other easy drag-and-drop operations.
The toolbars are configured in two places:
The tool set is configured in the Settings Configure Toolbars... menu item.
The graphic style (icon size, text position, & etc;) is adjusted through the Toolbar Context Menu. Right click the toolbar to access this menu.
This dialog allows you to customize the selection of tools on the toolbar. Open it choosing the Settings Configure Toolbars... menu item.
Available Actions
There are two rectangles below the toolbar title: Available actions and Current actions. Using the left and right arrows (located between the rectangles) you can move icons from the Available actions group to the Current actions group. The toolbar will have every icon that is in the Current actions box. The up and down arrows allow you reposition an icon.
Remember that less icons may be better, because the screen is less busy and therefore it is easier to find the toolbar buttons you actually use. For instance if you always cut and paste with the keyboard hotkeys, you do not need the Cut, Copy and Paste icons.
This menu allows you to change the look of the toolbars. Right click the toolbar to access this menu.
Text Position
Initially, icons do not have any text assigned. You may prefer having text under each icon, or text alongside each icon. You can also have plain texts without any icons.
Orientation
You can have the toolbar at the top, bottom, left or right side. If you choose Floating position, the toolbar will be displayed outside the main & korganizer; panel and you can move it around. If you choose Flat, the toolbar will collapse into a tiny rectangle. You can later click that rectangle and the toolbar will appear again.
Icon Size
You can change the size of the icons. Make your choice between small, medium and large icons.
Reference
Menus

Many windows contain buttons Default, Delete, OK, Apply, and Cancel. With these buttons you will decide whether the data that you entered into the window will be saved or forgotten.
Default
Delete
Click Delete to completely remove the event or event that you are editing from the calendar.
OK
When you click the OK button, your changes will be remembered and & korganizer; will close the window.
Apply
Cancel
If you click the Cancel button, your editing will be forgotten, and & korganizer; will close the window.
Other Features
In this chapter, you'll learn other useful features of & korganizer;: what tricks you can do with a click of your mouse and what interaction between & korganizer; and & konqueror; is possible.
You'll also learn about synchronizing with your & PalmPilot; or compatible handheld computer.
Command Line
A nice program to access a & kde; calendar from the command line is konsolekalendar, which is included in the kdepim package together with & korganizer;.
Drag and Drop Operations
& korganizer; can be easily controlled with your mouse. The supported drag-and-drop operations are detailed below.
Any event can be re-sized with your mouse. Simply move the mouse pointer near the top or bottom edge of the event, and drag the edge up or down. This way you can visually modify the starting and ending time of your appointment. This works in the Day, Week and Work Week views.
Any event can be rescheduled with your mouse. Move the mouse pointer over the event, and drag it to a new time location. This works in the Day, Week and Work Week views.
& konqueror; Interaction
& konqueror; recognizes the vCalendar format used by & korganizer;. If you use & konqueror; to navigate to your calendar, it will be displayed inside & konqueror; as a live object. You will be able to perform most operations with your calendar inside & konqueror;; you will not need to start & korganizer;. In technical jargon, this is described as embedding vCalendar as KPart inside & konqueror;.
Palm Synchronization
Palm Synchronization can be done via & kpilot;. Choose Settings Configure & kpilot; and check the Calendar (korganizer;) and To-do's (korganizer;) boxes. After synchronization the Calendar and To-do's should be visible in & korganizer;.
See the FAQ; for one of the most common & PalmPilot; syncing problems.
Questions and Answers
Can I import my old Ical data?
Sure! Follow the instructions in Import From & UNIX; Ical section.
Can I import data from & Microsoft; Outlook?
I'm trying to sync & korganizer; with my & PalmPilot;, but nothing happens. What else do I need to do?
Make sure no form of & korganizer; is running: neither & korganizer; itself nor the alarm daemon in the system tray.
Make sure the versions of the & kpilot; datebook conduit and & korganizer; are compatible.
Can I use freebusy-time with & korganizer;?
yes, follow the instructions in Free/ Busy.

Installation
How to Obtain & korganizer;
& install. intro. documentation;
Requirements
& korganizer; requires & kde; 3.4. It requires roughly 2MB of space in your & kde; system folder. Your calendars will require additional space in your home folder. Very large calendars slow down & korganizer; operation, therefore periodic cleanup is advisable.
& korganizer; needs about 5 Megabytes of memory to run, but this may vary depending on your platform and the size of your calendar(s).
All required libraries are part of standard & kde; libraries (kdelibs). & kde; base package (kdebase) must also be installed to change localization preferences like date and time formats. & korganizer; itself is in the kdepim package. All packages can be found on kde; home page.
The & korganizer; homepage is at http: / /korganizer. kde. org
Glossary
Calendar Widget
Date Navigator
Recurring events are not always displayed. You can forbid the display of recurring appointments in the Date Navigator. Get more information in the Views chapter.
Due Date
Main panel
Normally the largest part of the screen, to the right of the Date Navigator. It displays the View of the day, workdays, week or month, the List View or the to-do list view.
The right mouse button can be used in the List view and to-do list view only. It displays a local menu. The left mouse button can be used in any view.
Free/ busy
The free/ busy information is a set of busy time intervals. By presenting the intervals when one already has previous commitments, others can avoid arranging appointments for these periods. Note that only the times are published, not the event titles, descriptions or attendees. In other words, the free/ busy information is the availability schedule.
Some to-dos require attachments. You can Add..., Edit..., Remove, and Show attachments. You can refer to the attachment by entering the & URI; (path or Internet address) to the attachment.

This version of the & korganizer; workshop Outlook to vCalendar was released on October 17, 2002. See the ChangeLog for details.
Please note that the descriptions and screenshots refer to version 3.1 of & korganizer;.

Outlook2VCal
KOrganizer workshop: Outlook to vCalendar
Overview
Unfortunately, Outlookreg; will only export the appointment you have selected, one at a time. This is fine if you only wish to transfer a few appointments, but transferring the 200-300 appointments you may have in your Outlookreg; folder would not be much fun. Therefore, Randy Pearson created a small application named Outlook2VCal that can scan and export all the appointments to a vCalendar file at one time.
Installation
The Outlook2VCal 2.0 program is delivered as a compress ZIP file, which contains a SETUP. EXE application. Merely extract the files using your favorite utility, such as WinZip and run the SETUP. EXE program to install the program on your Windows computer. This should be the same computer where you normally run & Microsoft; Outlook 97reg;, 2000reg; or 2002reg;.
Export Usage
After the program is installed, you can run it by accessing Start Programs Outlook2vCal Outlook2vCal. You should see this screen appear:
Outlook2VCal main window
Outlook2VCal main window
Outlook2VCal main window
The program automatically attempts to communicate with Outlookreg; using OLE Automation. If an error is reported, this probably means you do not have Outlookreg; installed.
You should first decide if you want to include information about holidays in the exported file or not. Normally you will probably not wish to do this, so the Skip Holidays box is checked by default. Next, click the Export button, which will display a standard File Save dialog box. Browse to the desired folder and enter the filename where you wish to create the new vCalendar data file.
Outlook2VCal Save File dialog
Outlook2VCal Save File dialog
Outlook2VCal Save File dialog
Depending on the security settings in Outlookreg;, you may see this screen next. If so, be sure to allow access for a minute or two.

Import Usage
Now that you have exported Outlook'sreg; appointments, the final step is to load the appointments into & korganizer;. Transfer the file over to the computer running & korganizer; (via network, floppy disk, whatever). Now, run & korganizer;. If desired, you can create a new calendar, or open an existing one.

Now, choose the File Import Import Calendar menu item. Browse and/ or enter the name of the vCalendar file you just transferred to this computer.

After you select the OK button, & korganizer; will load the appointments from the file and update its calendar.

Limitations
The first version of this program (1.0) was tested on & Microsoft; Windows 2000 Serverreg; and Professionalreg; running & Microsoft; Outlook 2000reg;. When attempting to use & Microsoft; Outlook 97reg;, the program failed miserably.
The second (2.0) version, is reported to work (at least) with & Microsoft; Outlook 97reg;, 2000reg;, and 2002reg;.
If anyone has a work around for this problem, feel free to send a note to Randy Pearson (blueboy@bamafolks. com).

replace, sed style
search, sed style
s/ // [ig] %s/ // [ig]
This command does a sed-like search/ replace operation on the current line, or on the whole file (%s/ //).
To search for a literal (or), you need to escape it using a backslash character: \\(\\)
Imagine that you have a file, in which you mention a Miss Jensen several times, when someone comes in and tells you that she just got married to Mr Jones. You want, of course, to replace each and every occurrence of Miss Jensen with Ms Jones.
Enter the command line and issue the command %s/ Miss Jensen/ Ms Jones/ and hit return, you are done.

Launch the Editing Command Dialog, and enter: s/ \\s+(\\w+)\\s+(amp; )/ const \\1 \\2/ g and hit the OK button. The g at the end of the expression makes the regular expression recompile for each match to save the backreferences.
Output: void MyClass: :DoStringOps( const String & foo, const String & bar String *p, const int & a, const int & b)
goto INT line
find pattern
The find command can be configured by appending a colon followed by one or more options, the form is find: options pattern. The following options are supported:

Configuring & kate;
Overview
configure
settings
preferences
The Settings Menu
Allows you to change often used settings, and to launch the configuration dialogs.
The View Menu
The configuration is divided into two groups, namely
Application configuration
Behavior
Meta Information
When enabled, & kate; will store meta data such as bookmarks and session configuration even when you close your documents. The data will be used if the document is unchanged when reopened.
This section contains options related to using sessions.
If enabled, & kate; will save the window configuration with each session.
Select how you want & kate; to behave at startup. This setting can be overridden by specifying what to do on the command line.
With this option, & kate; will start a new, unnamed session when you start it.
& kate; will display a small dialog that lets you choose your preferred session. This is the default behavior. Nice if you use a lot of different sessions frequently.
Save Session
& kate; will save session data, except if the session is unnamed. With this option, your sessions are always restored just like you left them. This is the default behavior.

%directory
The directory part of the current documents URL or an empty string if the current document is unsaved.
%filename
%line
%column
%selection
%text
The full text of the current document. Beware that this will potentially exceed the maximum command length allowed on your system. Use with care.
Executable
Mime types
A semicolon separated list of mimetypes for which this command should be enabled. This is currently unused.
Save
If you fill this, the tool will be available in the editors command line as exttool- Command Line Name (the string you enter here prepended exttool-).
This group contains all pages related to the editor component of & kate;. Most of the settings here are defaults, they can be overridden by defining a filetype, by Document Variables or by changing them per document during an editing session.
Appearance
Word Wrap
Choose when the Dynamic word wrap indicators should be displayed.
Align dynamically wrapped lines to indentation depth:
Borders
If this is checked, you will see an icon border on the left hand side. The icon border shows bookmark signs for instance.
If this is checked, you will see line numbers on the left hand side.
If this option is checked the current view will show marks on the vertical scrollbar. These marks will for instance show bookmarks.

Kate variables is kateparts implementation of document variables, similar to emacs and vi modelines. In katepart, the lines have the format kate: VARIABLENAME VALUE; [VARIABLENAME VALUE;...] the lines can of course be in a comment, if the file is in a format with comments. Variable names are single words (no whitespace), and anything up to the next semicolon is the value. The semicolon is required.
/ / kate: space-indent on; indent-width 4; mixedindent off; indent-mode cstyle;
Only the first and last 10 lines are searched for variable lines.
The variables listed here documents & kate; version 2.4. More variables may be added in the future. There are 3 possible types of values for variables, with the following valid expressions:

Keyword lists
Rules
Context Styles and Keywords
Default Styles
The formal definition, aka the DTD is stored in the file language. dtd which should be installed on your system in the folder $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ katepart/ syntax.
A highlighting file contains a header that sets the XML version and the doctype:
& lt; ?xml version=quot; 1.0quot; encoding=quot; UTF-8quot; ?gt; & lt; !DOCTYPE language SYSTEM & quot; language. dtdquot; gt;
The root of the definition file is the element language. Available attributes are:
name sets the name of the language. It appears in the menus and dialogs afterwards.
section specifies the category.
extensions defines file extensions, like & quot; *. cpp; *. hquot;
mimetype associates files & MIME; Type based.
kateversion specifies the latest supported & kate; version.
casesensitive defines, whether the keywords are case sensitive or not.
priority is necessary if another highlight definition file uses the same extensions. The higher priority will win.
license contains the license, usually LGPL, Artistic, GPL and others.
hidden defines, whether the name should appear in & kate; 's menus.
So the next line may look like this:
& lt; language name=quot; C++quot; version=quot; 1.00quot; kateversion=quot; 2.4quot; section=quot; Sourcesquot; extensions=quot; *. cpp; *. hquot; / gt;
Next comes the highlighting element, which contains the optional element list and the required elements contexts and itemDatas.
list elements contain a list of keywords. In this case the keywords are class and const. You can add as many lists as you need.
The third part is the itemDatas element. It contains all color and font styles needed by the contexts and rules. In this example, the itemData Normal Text, String and Keyword are used.
The last part of a highlight definition is the optional general section. It may contain information about keywords, code folding, comments and indentation.
The comment section defines with what string a single line comment is introduced. You also can define a multiline comments using multiLine with the additional attribute end. This is used if the user presses the corresponding shortcut for comment/ uncomment.
& lt; generalgt; & lt; commentsgt; & lt; comment name="singleLine "start="#"/ gt; & lt; /commentsgt; & lt; keywords casesensitive="1"/ gt; & lt; /generalgt; & lt; /languagegt;
This part will describe all available attributes for contexts, itemDatas, keywords, comments, code folding and indentation.
lineEndContext defines the context the highlight system switches to if it reaches the end of a line. This may either be a name of another context, #stay to not switch the context (eg;. do nothing) or #pop which will cause to leave this context. It is possible to use for example #pop#pop#pop to pop three times.
lineBeginContext defines the context if a begin of a line is encountered. Default: #stay.
fallthrough defines if the highlight system switches to the context specified in fallthroughContext if no rule matches. Default: false.
name sets the name of the itemData. Contexts and rules will use this name in their attribute attribute to reference an itemData.
color defines a color. Valid formats are '#rrggbb 'or '#rgb'.
selColor defines the selection color.
italic if true, the text will be italic.
bold if true, the text will be bold.
underline if true, the text will be underlined.
strikeout if true, the text will be stroked out.
The element keywords in the group general defines keyword properties. Available attributes are:
casesensitive may be true or false. If true, all keywords are matched casesensitive
weakDeliminator is a list of characters that do not act as word delimiters. For example the dot '.' is a word delimiter. Assume a keyword in a list contains a dot, it will only match if you specify the dot as a weak delimiter.
additionalDeliminator defines additional delimiters.
wordWrapDeliminator defines characters after which a line wrap may occur.
Default delimiters and word wrap delimiters are the characters. ():! +, -lt; =gt; %amp; */;? []^{_BAR_}~\\, space ('') and tabulator ('\\t ').
The element comment in the group comments defines comment properties which are used for Tools Comment and Tools Uncomment. Available attributes are:
name is either singleLine or multiLine. If you choose multiLine the attributes end and region are required.
start defines the string used to start a comment. In C++ this would be & quot; /*quot;.
end defines the string used to close a comment. In C++ this would be & quot; */ quot;.
The element folding in the group general defines code folding properties. Available attributes are:
mode is the name of the indenter. Available indenters right now are: normal, cstyle, csands, xml, python and varindent.
Default Styles were already explained, as a short summary: Default styles are predefined font and color styles.
So here only the list of available default styles:
dsNormal, used for normal text.
dsKeyword, used for keywords.
dsDataType, used for data types.
dsDecVal, used for decimal values.
dsFloat, used for float values.
dsChar, used for a character.
dsString, used for strings.
dsComment, used for comments.
dsOthers, used for'other 'things.
dsAlert, used for warning messages.
dsFunction, used for function calls.
dsRegionMarker, used for region markers.
dsError, used for error highlighting and wrong syntax.
& lt; RuleName attribute=quot; (identifier)quot; context=quot; (identifier)quot; [rule specific attributes] / gt;
The context can be identified by:
An order telling the engine to stay in the current context (#stay), or to pop back to a previous context used in the string (#pop).
To go back more steps, the #pop keyword can be repeated: #pop#pop#pop
& lt; RuleName (attributes)gt; & lt; ChildRuleName (attributes) / gt;... & lt; /RuleNamegt;
Common attributes
attribute: An attribute maps to a defined itemData.
context: Specify the context to which the highlighting system switches if the rule matches.
beginRegion: Start a code folding block. Default: unset.
endRegion: Close a code folding block. Default: unset.
lookAhead: If true, the highlighting system will not process the matches length. Default: false.
firstNonSpace: Match only, if the string is the first non-whitespace in the line. Default: false.
column: Match only, if the column matches. Default: unset.
Dynamic rules
DetectChar
Detect a single specific character. Commonly used for example to find the ends of quoted strings.
& lt; DetectChar char=quot; (character)quot; (common attributes) (dynamic) / gt;
The char attribute defines the character to match.
Detect2Chars
& lt; Detect2Chars char=quot; (character)quot; char1=quot; (character)quot; (common attributes) (dynamic) / gt;
The char attribute defines the first character to match, char1 the second.
AnyChar
Detect one character of a set of specified characters.
& lt; AnyChar String=quot; (string)quot; (common attributes) / gt;
The String attribute defines the set of characters.
StringDetect
Detect an exact string.
& lt; StringDetect String=quot; (string)quot; [insensitive=quot; true_BAR_falsequot;] (common attributes) (dynamic) / gt;
The String attribute defines the string to match. The insensitive attribute defaults to false and is passed to the string comparison function. If the value is true insensitive comparing is used.
RegExpr
& lt; RegExpr String=quot; (string)quot; [insensitive=quot; true_BAR_falsequot;] [minimal=quot; true_BAR_falsequot;] (common attributes) (dynamic) / gt;
The String attribute defines the regular expression.
See Regular Expressions for more information on those.
keyword
Detect a keyword from a specified list.
& lt; keyword String=quot; (list name)quot; (common attributes) / gt;
Int
Detect an integer number.
& lt; Int (common attributes) (dynamic) / gt;
This rule has no specific attributes. Child rules are typically used to detect combinations of L and U after the number, indicating the integer type in program code. Actually all rules are allowed as child rules, though, the DTD only allows the child rule StringDetect.
The following example matches integer numbers follows by the character'L '.
& lt; Int attribute="Decimal "context="#stay" & gt; & lt; StringDetect attribute="Decimal "context="#stay" String="L "insensitive="true"/ gt; & lt; /Intgt;
Float
& lt; Float (common attributes) / gt;
This rule has no specific attributes. AnyChar is allowed as a child rules and typically used to detect combinations, see rule Int for reference.
HlCOct
Detect an octal point number representation.
& lt; HlCOct (common attributes) / gt;
This rule has no specific attributes.
HlCHex
Detect a hexadecimal number representation.
& lt; HlCHex (common attributes) / gt;
HlCStringChar
Detect an escaped character.
& lt; HlCStringChar (common attributes) / gt;
The following characters will match if they follow a backslash (\\): abefnrtvquot; '?\\. Additionally, escaped hexadecimal numbers like for example \\xff and escaped octal numbers, for example \\033 will match.
HlCChar
Detect an C character.
& lt; HlCChar (common attributes) / gt;
It matches C characters enclosed in a tick (Example: 'c '). So in the ticks may be a simple character or an escaped character. See HlCStringChar for matched escaped character sequences.
RangeDetect
& lt; RangeDetect char=quot; (character)quot; char1=quot; (character)quot; (common attributes) / gt;
LineContinue
& lt; LineContinue (common attributes) / gt;
This rule is useful for switching context at end of line, if the last character is a backslash ('\\ '). This is needed for example in C/ C++ to continue macros or strings.
IncludeRules
Include rules from another context or language/ file.
& lt; IncludeRules context=quot; contextlinkquot; [includeAttrib=quot; true_BAR_falsequot;] / gt;
The context attribute defines which context to include.
If it a simple string it includes all defined rules into the current context, example:
& lt; IncludeRules context=quot; anotherContextquot; / gt;
& lt; IncludeRules context=quot; ##C++quot; / gt;
DetectSpaces
Detect whitespaces.
& lt; DetectSpaces (common attributes) / gt;
DetectIdentifier
& lt; DetectIdentifier (common attributes) / gt;
Tips & Tricks
If you only match two characters use Detect2Chars instead of StringDetect. The same applies to DetectChar.
& lt; Detect2Chars attribute=quot; Commentquot; context=quot; #popquot; char=quot; *quot; char1=quot; /quot; lookAhead=quot; truequot; / gt;
Use DetectIdentifier instead of the regular expression '[a-zA-Z_]\\w* '.
You can validate every XML file by using the command xmllint --dtdvalid language. dtd mySyntax. xml.
If you repeat complex regular expression very often you can use ENTITIES. Example:
& lt; ?xml version="1.0 "encoding="UTF-8"? gt; & lt; !DOCTYPE language SYSTEM "language. dtd" [& lt; !ENTITY myref "[A-Za-z_: ][\\w. :_-]*"gt; ]gt;

Regular Expressions
Introduction
Patterns
Assertions
Quantifiers
Back references
The string {0,4} is a quantifier saying anywhere from 0 up to 4 of the previous.
Patterns
Escaping characters
Escaping of course includes the backslash character itself, to literally match a such, you would write\\\\.
Character Classes and abbreviations
Simple character classes just contains one or more literal characters, for example [abc] (matching either of the letters a, b or c) or [0123456789] (matching any digit).
Because letters and digits have a logical order, you can abbreviate those by specifying ranges of them: [a-c] is equal to [abc] and [0-9] is equal to [0123456789]. Combining these constructs, for example [a-fynot1-38] is completely legal (the last one would match, of course, either of a, b, c, d, e, f, y, n, o, t, 1, 2, 3 or 8).
[^abc] will match any character but a, b or c.
\\a
This matches the ASCII bell character (BEL, 0x07).
\\f
This matches the ASCII form feed character (FF, 0x0C).
\
This matches the ASCII line feed character (LF, 0x0A, Unix newline).
\\r
This matches the ASCII carriage return character (CR, 0x0D).
\\t
This matches the ASCII horizontal tab character (HT, 0x09).
\\v
This matches the ASCII vertical tab character (VT, 0x0B).
\\xhhhh
This matches the Unicode character corresponding to the hexadecimal number hhhh (between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF). \\0ooo (ie;, \\zero ooo) matches the ASCII / Latin-1 character corresponding to the octal number ooo (between 0 and 0377).
. (dot)
This matches any character (including newline).
\\d
This matches a digit. Equal to [0-9]
\\D
This matches a non-digit. Equal to [^0-9] or [^\\d]
\\s
This matches a whitespace character. Practically equal to [\\t\ \\r]
\\S
This matches a non-whitespace. Practically equal to [^ \\t\\r\], and equal to [^\\s]
\\w
\\W
Matches any non-word character - anything but letters or numbers. Equal to [^a-zA-Z0-9] or [^\\w]
The POSIX notation of classes, [: lt; class namegt;:] is currently not supported.
]
^ (caret)
- (dash)
\\ (backslash)
The escape character. Must always be escaped.
Alternatives: matching one of
For example to find either John or Harry you would use an expression John_BAR_Harry.
Sub Patterns
Specifying alternatives
Lookahead Assertions
A lookahead assertion is a sub pattern, starting with either? = or?!.
For example to match the literal string Bill but only if not followed by Gates, you could use this expression: Bill(?! Gates). (This would find Bill Clinton as well as Billy the kid, but silently ignore the other matches.)
See also Assertions
The escape character.
$
() (left and right parentheses)
Denotes sub patterns.
{} (left and right curly braces)
Denotes numeric quantifiers.
[] (left and right square brackets)
Denotes character classes.
_BAR_ (vertical bar)
logical OR. Separates alternatives.
+ (plus sign)
Quantifier, 1 or more.
* (asterisk)
Quantifier, 0 or more.
? (question mark)
An optional character. Can be interpreted as a quantifier, 0 or 1.
Quantifiers
Quantifiers are enclosed in curly brackets ({and}) and have the general form {[minimum-occurrences][, [maximum-occurrences]]}
{1}
Exactly 1 occurrence
{0,1}
Zero or 1 occurrences
{,1}
{5,10}
{5,}
At least 5 occurrences, no maximum.
Additionally, there are some abbreviations:
similar to {0,}, find any number of occurrences.
similar to {1,}, at least 1 occurrence.
similar to {0,1}, zero or 1 occurrence.
Greed
\\s+
(bla){1,}
Matches all of blablabla and the bla in blackbird or tabla
/ ?gt;
Matches / gt; in lt; closeditem/ gt; as well as gt; in lt; openitemgt;.
Assertions
^ (caret: beginning of string)
The expression ^Peter will match at Peter in the string Peter, hey! but not in Hey, Peter!
\\b (word boundary)
\\B (non word boundary)
Matches wherever \\b does not.
That means that it will match for example within words: The expression \\Bin\\B will match at in window but not in integer or I'm in love.
(? =PATTERN) (Positive lookahead)
The expression handy(? =\\w) will match at handy in handyman but not in That came in handy!
(? !PATTERN) (Negative lookahead)
The expression const \\w+\\b(? !\\s*amp;) will match at const char in the string const char* foo while it can not match const QString in const QStringamp; bar because the amp; matches the negative lookahead assertion pattern.

Once an archive has been opened, you can perform various operations on the files inside the archive. By selecting a file and using the Action menu, you can choose what you want to do:
Add File... will add files from your disk to the archive.
Add Folder... will add folders from your disk to the archive.
Delete will remove the currently selected file(s) from the archive.
Extract... will extract the file to a location you specify on disk.
Preview will open the file in the associated viewer.
Extracting Archives
Selected files only extracts only the files which have been selected.
All files extracts the entire contents of the archive.
To create a new archive in & ark;, choose New from the File menu.

Starting
Backend Selection
Choose the backend protocol that & CUPS; is supposed to use with your new printer. There are:
local printer (serial, parallel, USB)
remote LPD queue
SMB shared printer (Windows;)
Network Printer (TCP, & HP; JetDirect, AppSocket)
Network printer with & IPP; (IPP; / HTTP)
File printer
If some choices are grayed out, they are not available. For example, you may have no FAX backend software or no modem installed to use it.
& kdeprint; wizard network scan
In the case of & IPP; (Port 631) and TCP Network/ AppSocket (Port 9100) & kdeprint; will try to open the port and, if successful, send an ipp-get-printer-attribute request to the printer. For newer & HP; printers the latter usually works, because they support both AppSocket and & IPP;.
& kdeprint; wizard network configuration dialog
Driver Selection
On the next screen you will see a description of the driver selected previously. This description is extracted from the actual & PPD; used.
For a real & PostScript; printer never try to install a Foomatic or Gimp-Print & PPD;, even if it is offered. You wo n't be happy with it. Instead find the original & PPD; from the manufacturer, preferably the one written for & Windows; NT and use it.
If you are not sure which ones to use go to:
http: / /www. linuxprinting. org
http: / /www. cups. org
And ask for help. At a later stage, a document detailing the differences between the different driver and & PPD; models will appear at http: / /kdeprint. sourceforge. net/ Watch out for this!
Specify your first driver settings now. The most important one is the default paper size. In many cases this is set to Letter. If you live in an A4 country and do n't want your first test page to jam: now is the time to prevent this.
You are ready to start a test print. Hit the Test button.
Banner Selection
If you need to use custom banners, copy them into / usr/ share/ cups/ banners/ to make them available for selection. They must be & PostScript; files, however.
Finally: Baptizing Your New Printer
The last screen lets you insert a name for your new printer.
The name must start with a letter and may contain numbers and underscores with a maximum size of 128 characters. Conform to this if you want to avoid erratic behavior of your & CUPS; daemon. The printer names in & CUPS; are not case sensitive! This is a requirement of & IPP;. So the names DANKA_infotec, Danka_Infotec and danka_infotec all represent the same printer.

Print Server Configuration: CUPS
cp / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf. bak
Quick Help
If & CUPS; is not running, but installed on your system you could find it in your own host's file system. The exact location depends on your & OS;, but on & Linux; the default is / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ or / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ documentation. html.)
Longer Help
For the best, most detailed and most recent information you should always refer to the original & CUPS; documentation. & CUPS; is, much like & kde; in a rapid development process. There are constantly new features being added. New features might for times be only configurable by directly editing the configuration files. The & kdeprint; & GUI; might not have caught up with & CUPS; development.
These paths are based on the default installation. Your & OS; may have installed them to a different prefix, for example, / usr/ local/, but the hierarchy should still match that shown below.
/ etc/ cups/
/ etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf
/ etc/ cups/ printers. conf
/ etc/ cups/ ppd/
The folder with & PPD; files of your installed printers.
The following links only work if your & CUPS; daemon is up and running. To access all the original & CUPS; documentation, go to:
http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html
A page with all the links to the other documents.
http: / /localhost:631/ sam. html
Direct access to the & CUPS; Software Administrator Manual in HTML format.
http: / /localhost:631/ sam. pdf
Direct access to the & CUPS; Software Administrator Manual in PDF format.
http: / /www. cups. org/ documentation. html
The latest on line documentation from the & CUPS; web site.
The following links give you access to the same files (probably icons and graphics will be missing) even if your CUPS daemon is not up and running. You need, however, CUPS installed on your system. (Some distributions might place the files somewhere else -- you're on your own then to find out where...) To access all the original CUPS documentation, go to:
/ usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ documentation. html
/ usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ sam. html
/ usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ sam. pdf

The Tabs
Every setting has a default value. The defaults let & CUPS; normally work as a fully functional client. The clients listen on TCP/ IP Port 631 for infos broadcast by & CUPS; servers on the LAN. This information let the clients print immediately after receiving them, without installing any driver or configuring any printer on the clients.

If you are unsure, leave alone and turn to the original & CUPS; documentation first. If your & CUPS; daemon is already running, it is readable from the & konqueror; by pointing it to & URL; http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html.
There, first make friends with the Software Administrator Manual. Otherwise, for example, if the & CUPS; daemon is not running, try looking in your local file system, by default at / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ or / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ documentation. html.

The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server general settings: ServerName, AdminMail, ServerUser, ServerGroup, RemoteUserName
Server Name
The hostname of your server, as advertised to the world. By default, & CUPS; will use the hostname of the system. To set the default server usd by clients, see the client. conf file.
For example, enter myhost. domain. com
This is the email address to send all complaints or problems to. By default & CUPS; will use root@hostname.
For example, enter root@myhost. com.
Server User
The user the server runs under. Normally this must be lp, however you can configure things for another user if needed.
The server must be initially run as root to support the default IPP port of 631. It changes users whenever an external program is run.
Enter for example lp.
This is the & UNIX; user account for filters and CGI programs to run under. (CGI programs are responsible for showing you the nice web administration interface accessible via http: / /localhost:631/).
The group the server runs under. Normally this must be sys, however you can configure things for another group as needed.
Enter for example sys.
The name of the user assigned to unauthenticated accesses from remote systems. By default remroot.
This name will appear in log files and in queries about the job owner & etc;, for all resources and locations of the & CUPS; server that are configured to allow access without authentication. Authenticated entries will carry the authenticated names.

You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon.
Enter a path, for example / var/ log/ cups/ acces_log.
To include the server name in the file name use a %s in the name. Example: / var/ log/ cups/ access_log-%s.
If this does not start with a leading /, then it is assumed to be relative to the server root. The default setting is / var/ log/ cups/ error_log.
Enter the path, for example / var/ log/ cups/ error_log.
kurt@transmeta: ~ > tail / var/ log/ cups/ error_log I [04/ Aug/ 2001:23:15:10 +0100] Job 213 queued on'DANKA_P450 'by'root' I [04/ Aug/ 2001:23:15:10 +0100] Started filter / usr/ lib/ cups/ filter/ pstops (PID 18891) for job 213. I [04/ Aug/ 2001:23:15:10 +0100] Started backend / usr/ lib/ cups/ backend/ lpd (PID 18892) for job 213.
If this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to the server root. The default is / var/ log/ cups/ page_log
Enter the path, for example / var/ log/ cups/ page_log.
Here is what some entries look like:
In this excerpt of the file you find information on the name of the printers (GIMP_print_stp_HP and DANKA_infotec_P450) used through this server, the user names (kdetest, kurt and root), the job-IDs (201 to 205), time of printing, page number inside the job and the number of copies for the pages. For example, job-ID 204 had 4 pages and 33 copies printed, job-ID 205 had 14 copies of just 1 page).
Log level
This setting controls the number of messages logged to the error log file. It can be one of the following:
debug2
Log everything.
debug
Log almost everything.
info
Log all requests and state changes.
warn
Log errors and warnings.
error
none
Log nothing.
You can use this to watch live what & CUPS; is doing when you send a print job. In a & konsole; type:
kurt@transmeta: ~ > tail -f -n 100 / var/ log/ cups/ error_log
The lines tagged D at the beginning are debug level entries, the ones tagged I are there in info level.
Controls the maximum size of each log file before they are rotated. Defaults to 1048576 (1 Mb). Set this to 0 to disable log rotation.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server. Different folders are to be set here. Normally you do n't need to change anything in this section. In case you play around with fancy (TrueType, & PostScript; or other) fonts on your system, this is the place to do the settings for using those fonts when printing. Server folder settings include:
Executables: where to find the server executables
Configuration: where to find the server configuration files
Data: where to find the server data files
Temporary files: where to put the server temporary print files
Temporary Requests: where to find the server
Font Path: where to find the server fonts
& CUPS; server configuration dialog: & HTTP; configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: & HTTP; configuration
Executables
The root folder for the scheduler executables. By default this is / usr/ lib/ cups (or / usr/ lib32/ cups on IRIX 6.5)
Configuration
The root folder for the scheduler. By default, / etc/ cups.
On the authors SuSE system, this is / usr/ share/ doc/ cups. It contains all the HTML or PDF documentation for & CUPS; which is available through the Web interface at http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html
Data
The root folder for the & CUPS; data files. By default this is / usr/ share/ cups
It contains such things as banners, charsets, data, drivers, fonts, and pstoraster templates.
Temporary files
The folder to put temporary files in. This folder must be writable by the user defined on the previous screen. This defaults to either / var/ spool/ cups/ tmp or the value of the TMPDIR environment variable.
Temporary Requests
The folder where request files are stored. By default this is / var/ spool/ cups
Font path
The place to configure the & CUPS; server for handling your fancy fonts (TrueType or & PostScript;). & CUPS; will look here for fonts to embed in printfiles. This currently only affects the pstoraster filter, and the default is / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts.
To specify more than one folder, list them with double colons as separator. Do it like this:
/ path/ to/ first/ fontdir/: / path/ to/ second/ fontdir/: / path/ to/ last/ fontdir/
Either correctly reference its desired fonts in the header of the generated & PostScript;
Or embed the font into the & PostScript; file.
Referencing the font by name leaves it up to the RIP and print device to respect and actually use it. RIP or printer can only use the desired font, if it is available on the system.
Server HTTP Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server & HTTP; settings is shown here.
& CUPS; server & HTTP; settings are the following ones:
Document folder
The root folder for & HTTP; documents that are served. By default the compiled in folder, / usr/ share/ cups/ doc
Default Language
The default language, if not specified by the browser. If not specified, the current locale is used.
Use the two letter locale codes, for example en or de.
Default charset
The default character set to use. If not specified, this defaults to UTF-8. This can also be overridden directly in the HTML documents.
This is the dialog to configure the & CUPS; server security settings. The server encryption support settings are these:
Server certificate: the file to read containing the server's certificate
Server key: the file to read containing the server's key
& CUPS; server configuration dialog: security overview
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: security settings
Server certificate
The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt.
Server key
The file to read containing the server's key. Defaults to / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server miscellaneous settings is shown here. The following server settings are done through this screen:
Preserve job history: whether to preserve a job history for later re-view
Preserve job files: whether to preserve fully RIP -ed job files for later re-print
Printcap file: setting the name of and the path to a printcap file
RIP Cache: setting the size of the RIP cache in memory
Filter Limit: defining a filter limit
Whether or not to preserve the job history after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. The default is yes
Whether or not to preserve the job files after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. The default is no.
Printcap file
The name of the printcap file. The default is no filename. Leave this blank, to disable printcap file generation.
RIP cache
The amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache bitmaps. The value can be any real number, followed by k for kilobytes, m for megabytes, g for gigabytes, or t for tiles, where one tile is 256 x 256 pixels. The default value is 8m.
Filter limit
Sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time. A limit of 0 means no limit. A typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200. Limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time. The default limit is 0 (unlimited).
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server network settings is shown here. It includes:
Port
Timeout
Whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a fully-qualified hostname. This defaults to off, for performance reasons.
Enter here Ports and addresses that the server will listen to. The default port 631 is reserved for the Internet Printing Protocol, and is what we use here.
Unfortunately, most web browsers do n't support TLS or & HTTP; upgrades for encryption. If you want to support web-based encryption, you'll probably need to listen on port 443, the HTTPS port.
Use the Add and Remove buttons to add and remove entries from the list.
You can enter ports on their own, & eg; 631, or hostnames with ports, & eg; myhost:80 or 1.2.3.4:631.
Controls the maximum size of & HTTP; requests and print files. The default setting is 0, which disables this feature.
The timeout (in seconds) before requests time out. The default is 300 seconds.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; network client settings is shown here. It includes:
Accept "Keep Alive" requests
Whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection option. The default is on.
The timeout (in seconds) before Keep-Alive connections are automatically closed. The default is 60 seconds.
Controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that will be handled. Defaults to 100.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; browsing general settings is shown here. It includes:
Enable browsing
Whether or not to broadcast printer information to other & CUPS; servers. Enabled by default.
Whether or not to use short names for remote printers when possible (eg; printer instead of printer@host). Enabled by default.
Whether or not to use implicit classes.
Printer classes can be specified explicitly, in the classes. conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both.
This option is enabled by default.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server browsing connection is shown here. Browsing connection settings include:
Broadcast addresses: The (UDP) broadcast address to transmit printer information to
Broadcast Port: The port number to use for broadcasting
Poll addresses: The address(es) to poll for information about printers on servers that might not broadcast (or whose broadcasts might not reach your LAN due to routers in between).
Broadcast addresses
This option specifies a broadcast address to be used. By default, browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces.
& HP-UX; 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C or D netmask (ie;, there is no CIDR support).
Broadcast port
The port used for UDP broadcasts. By default this is the IPP port; if you change this, you need to do it on all servers. Only one BrowsePort is recognized.
Poll addresses
Poll the named server(s) for printers.
Add Browse Address dialog
Browse allow and Browse deny
Browse allow specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses.
Browse deny specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses.
Both Browse allow and Browse deny accept the following notations for addresses:
All
None
*. domain. com
. domain. com
host. domain. com
nnn. *
nnn. nnn. *
nnn. nnn. nnn. *
nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn
nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm
nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm
Browse order
Specifies the order of the allow/ deny comparisons.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server browse timeout settings is shown here. Browse timeout settings include:
Browse Interval
Browse Timeout
Browse interval
The time between browsing updates in seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
Browse timeouts
This number definitely should not be less than the browse interval period, for obvious reasons. Defaults to 300 seconds.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server as a browsing relay is shown here. Browsing relay settings include:
Relay browser packets from one address or network to another.
Security Configuration
Auth Group Name:
Valid resources (or locations) of the & CUPS; server are:
Server Root Location: /
Server Administration Location: / admin
Any individual printer on the server: & eg; / printers/ infotec_P320
All printer classes on the server: / classes:
Any individual printer class on the server: & eg; / classes/ all_infotecs_P320_or_P450
SystemGroup
The group name for System or printer administration access. The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be sys, system or root (checked for in that order).
Access Permissions
Access permissions for each folder served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to the document root.
Authorization Type
The authorization to use:
None
Perform no authentication.
Basic
Perform authentication using the & HTTP; Basic method.
Digest
Perform authentication using the & HTTP; Digest method.
Authorization Class
The authorization class. Currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to the group set as system group), and group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
Encryption
Whether or not to use encryption. This depends on having the OpenSSL linked into the & CUPS; library and scheduler.
Possible values are:
Always
Always use encryption (SSL)
Never
Required
Use TLS encryption upgrade.
IfRequested
Use encryption if the server requests it.
Allow
Allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address or network. Possible values are:
Deny
Denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address or network. Possible values are:
Order
The order of the allow and deny processing.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server security settings is discussed here. We use the example to add security definitions other than the default ones for the resource named all printers. For the & CUPS; web server, this is the location you access through http: / /localhost:631/ printers/ or (remotely) through http: / /cups. server. name:631/ printers/
The first screenshot shows the general location for this setting. Select Add or Modify a resource for which you want to decide about its security settings.
This dialog is to add a new resource. It looks similar if you want to modify an already existing resource. Here are the general options:

& CUPS; options presently not available through & kcontrol;
All of the most often used features and functions & CUPS; provides are supported in & kdeprint;.
Printer management is supported: add, remove, modify, configure, test, disable, enable...
Job management is supported: cancel, hold, release, move to different printer
Print options: for full control as provided by & CUPS;.
A lot of information about the inner workings of & CUPS; is available through the web interface, which & CUPS; will always support. It works with any browser (yes, even text-based ones). Just go to http: / /localhost:631/ for a start. There you find a link to locally available & CUPS; documentation in HTML and PDF if you are new to & CUPS;.
& CUPS; is accessible through other means than & kdeprint;: commandline and browser are two native & CUPS; interfaces. The many commandline utilities add up to the most complete control you have on & CUPS;. The web interface is only a subset of all available configuration or control options.
This is also true for & kdeprint;. Generally, as & CUPS; develops, most new features will first be implemented through the commandline. Be sure to check the latest versions of the man pages for & CUPS; to stay up-to-date with new features after you install a new version.
How to find & CUPS; related man pages
Here is a way to find out which & CUPS; related man pages there are on your system:
Outside & kdeprint;: Hints & Tips Tricks with & CUPS; on the Commandline
lpadmin -p HeidelbergDigimaster9110 -v lpd: / 10.160.16.99/ mqueue -u allow: kurt, sylvi, hansjoerg -E -P / home/ kurt/ PPDs/ DVHV. ppd
lpadmin -p HeidelbergDigimaster9110 -v lpd: / 10.160.16.99/ mqueue -u deny: tackat, boss, waba -E -P / home/ kurt/ PPDs/ DVHV. ppd
With & CUPS; you may have pagecount- and filesize-based quotas for individual printers.
Quotas include banner pages (if those are used).
There are job-k-limit, job-page-limit, and job-quota-period options to give when setting up a printer.
job-quota-period sets a time interval for quota computing (intervals are determined in seconds; so a day is 60x60x24=86.400, a week is 60x60x24x7=604,800, and a month is 60x60x24x30=2.592.000 seconds.)
The default value of 0 for job-k-limit specifies that there is no limit.
The default value of 0 for job-page-limit specifies that there is no limit.
Working, as both, time-period plus one or both job-limits are defined
This sets a limit of a file size of 1 MB (in total) for each user of existing printer danka_infotec_4850 during one week.
This sets a limit of 100 pages (in total) for each user of existing printer danka_infotec_4105 during one week.
This sets a combined limit of 1 MB (in total) and 100 pages (in total) for each user of existing printer danka_infotec_P450 during one week. Whichever limit is reached first will take effect.
NOT working, as only one, time-period or job-limit is defined)
Once a user reaches his quota limit, he'll get a client-error-not-possible message, if he wants to print.
Installing a raw printer
There are different ways to define a raw printer. One comfortable one is to use the lpadmin command. Just do n't define a & PPD; file to be used for that printer and it will be a raw one:
lpadmin -p Raw_Danka_infotec -E -v lpd: / /10.160.16.137/ PORT1
Troubleshooting & CUPS; in & kdeprint;
This section of the & kdeprint; Handbook will live from the readers' feedback. Here is just a small beginning.
Error Messages
What does the error client-error-bad-request mean?
The user sent a file to the & CUPS; which the server could not process. You get this also upon sending an empty file.
Questions and Answers
To be able to re-start your completed jobs from the web interface, you need a setting in the / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf file: set PreserveJobFiles True.
TODO
How does page accounting work?
& CUPS; does the print accounting by passing nearly every job through the pstops filter. This one does, amongst other things, the page counting. Output of this filter there may be piped into other filters (like pstoraster -- > rastertopcl) or sent to the printer directly (if it is a & PostScript; printer).
By the way: on my personal wishlist is a hack of webalizer to read and analyze the page_log and give a similar output. Anyone?
However, it is not giving correct results in the following cases:
Jobs printed as raw are always counted as size of 1 page (and maybe multiple copies).
See the man page for the lpoptions command. You may investigate a & CUPS; -enabled box about any option of its available printers. There is no need to have the printer installed locally. As long as the printer is available locally (through the & CUPS; printer browsing feature), it will also work remote.
How do I read the listing retrieved by the lpoptions command?
Let's take an example. Looking at Hitachi's DDP70 printer and how it implements duplex printing is revealing somehow. How do you tell how to print double sided? duplex or Duplex? Or another name altogether?.
lpoptions -h transmeta -p Hitachi_DDP70_ClusterPrintingSystem -l _BAR_ grep uplex
This is to be interpreted like follows:
The present setting is True to be recognized by the marking with a star *.
lpr -P Hitachi_DDP70_ClusterPrintingSystem -o TR-Duplex=False / path/ to/ your/ printjob
Use the lphelp command which may be installed on your system locally. There is not yet a man page for lphelp.
lphelp infotecP450
This lists the available options for the named printer. It is nicely formatted and does explain every available option and how to use it. You can query different printers' options at once:
lphelp infotec7410color DANKA_fullcolor_D2000 HP_ColorLaserJet8550
It also works for & PPD; files. Just specify the path to the & PPD;:
lphelp / home/ kurt/ PPDs/ HP-ColorLaserJet8550. ppd
Solving Problems
No system is perfect. Here are some commonly seen traps people have fallen into.
My printer named 3-lp-duplex shows erratic behavior. What's wrong?
The printer names used in & CUPS; shall start with a letter and may contain up to 128 letters, numbers or underscores. Using dashes may lead to problems. Speaking about naming: printer names in & CUPS; are not case sensitive. So a printer named Best_of_Danka will be the same as best_of_danka or BEST_OF_DANKA. (This is a requirement of & IPP;, which & CUPS; is fully compliant with).
Virtual Printers
The Fax Printer
The File Printer
The PDF Printer
External Filters
The enscript Filter for Text Files
The n-up Filter for Any File
This module allows the print command to be specified completely (Netscape; -like). An edit line is added in the print dialog for that purpose. Can be used in many cases, for example with a self-made print program.
Printer management: not supported
Print options: basic control, depending on your knowledge of the print command

Caveats
Getting Started
This chapter of the & kdeprint; Handbook will walk you through most of the configuration or selection options of & kdeprint;. It will mainly deal with & CUPS; in this version, as the author is most familiar with it, and also because & kdeprint; started off with supporting & CUPS; best. Later versions of the & kdeprint; software and editions of this handbook will support and explore other printing systems more closely.
Navigate to K Menu Preferences System Printing Manager. At the bottom you can see a button that lets you select which printing subsystem you want to use. In & kde; 2.2 you can choose from the following alternatives:
LPR (Standard BSD Print System)
On its first startup, & kdeprint; will try an autodetection. This only works for:
LPD, as it is checking for a running LPD daemon, plus a printcap file.
The system you choose must be installed on your system prior to your selection. The author's personal recommendation is & CUPS;.
Once autodetected, chosen, or changed, the active print subsystem will take effect for all & kde; applications. Different users may have different print subsystems in use, if those do exist on the computer and are compliant with each other. Their settings are stored in the kdeprintrc. This file is unique to every user, and is normally installed in $HOME /. kde/ share/ config/ kdeprintrc.
& kdeprint; 's Highlights
& kdeprint; has an Add Printer Wizard. The Add Printer Wizard helps you with adding and configuring a new printer. Of course, you may do this manually as well.
& kdeprint; helps you discover printers. It is able to scan the environment for available devices and queues. This works for network connections using TCP (AppSocket, aka & HP; JetDirect, or IPP) or SMB / Samba (shared & Windows;) printers and partially for directly attached printers over parallel, serial, or USB connections.
The wizard makes the installation and handling of the drivers a snap. Selecting, configuring and testing should be easy as never before on any & Linux; -like system.
Hold and release jobs,
Cancel pending or processing jobs.
A screenshot of the & kdeprint; PrintJob Viewer shows the information you get: Job-ID, target printer, job name, job owner, job status and job size. In the next & kdeprint; release you will also see information about the number of pages (as & CUPS; calculates it; see chapter on page accounting for more information about its merits and limitations).
Here's a screenshot of the & kdeprint; PrintJob Viewer.
A screenshot of the & kdeprint; PrintJob Viewer.
An alternative way to looking at the same information (and having the same amount of control) is through the & kcontrolcenter; selecting System Printing Manager. If you do n't see the Printer Information, right click on the window background and select View Printer Information. Then go to the Jobs tab to see this:
LPD (BSD style)
LPRng (RedHat;, if you just use it's BSD style subset),
RLPR (a command-line LPR utility, which does n't need a printcap file.
external print commands (Netscape; like).
Most importantly, full support for & CUPS; is already there. Modules for other print subsystems, such as PLP, PPR and PDQ may be available later.
& kdeprint; makes & kde; much more flexible. It gives freedom of choice to & kde; 2.2 users. To use different available print subsystems, these must, of course, be installed independently from & kde;. In former versions, users were stuck with the old LPD style print subsystems. Now they can even use & CUPS;. In the future, there will be easy integration of new subsystems, as they appear on the scene.
More & kdeprint; Goodies
Benefitting all Print SubSystems.
Print Preview
Special Printers
Amongst these additional & kdeprint; features are a few special or virtual printers:
These special printers may:
Print to PDF
Convert your document into a PDF file with the help of an external program.
Print to PS file
Save your document as a & PostScript; file.
Send it through an available backend, such as Hylafax as a fax.
These special printers appear in the user print dialog just like normal printers. They are entirely configurable on a per-user basis.
Generic Pre-Filtering
There are a few useful filters already predefined. These are:
the enscript text filter,
and three filters to help print pamphlets.
This is a predefined filter that installs with & kdeprint;. It allows you to create a modified & PostScript; output, from & PostScript; input, that prints 1, 2, or 4 logical pages on a single sheet of paper.
Enscript Text Filter
& CUPS; Support: the Most Important Module in & kdeprint;
Experienced & kde; users may already be familiar with Michael's utilities qtcups and kups (co-developed with Jean-Eric Cuendet). These were, up until now, the graphical & GUI; front ends for & CUPS; with a strong relation to & kde;.
qtcups and kups & mdash; The Predecessors
Both utilities are probably still widely used. For those not familiar with them, here are brief explanations.
qtcups was a graphical front end for the lp or lpr print commands as installed by & CUPS;. Using qtcups opened a dialog. This dialog let you comfortably select your printer and the print job options. qtcups worked from the command line, or from within applications, when the application in question had a configurable print command.
kups was a graphical wrapper to do the administration tasks for your & CUPS; server, and the & CUPS; daemon at the heart of it. You could add, delete, modify, configure, start, and stop printers. You could cancel, delete, move, stop and restart print jobs, and you could change the settings of the daemon, start, stop, and restart it.
& kdeprint; & mdash; The Heir
The & CUPS; Module in & kdeprint; now contains all (and more) functions that were provided by qtcups and kups in former & kde; versions.
Instead of qtcups you can now use the kprinter command. And in place of kups you will probably use kcmshell printmgr from now on.
The & kdeprint; module for & CUPS; also lets you fully administer the print subsystem, just like kups did before. It can start, stop and configure your & CUPS; daemon. It can also start, stop, add and delete printers (ie; printer queues) and printer instances. Printer instances are printer queues that point to the same physical output device but with a different default setting of print options.
& kdeprint; 's & CUPS; module gives you access to a graphical print command, like qtcups did before.
Use & kprinter; in any application, even a non-kde; application, that lets you configure your print command. Examples of these are & Netscape; and StarOffice, but not most pre-kde; 2.2 programs.
A screenshot how to use the new kprinter print command instead of the old-fashioned lpr... Of course you need to have kprinter in your $PATH, or give the full path in the dialog; & eg; / opt/ kde/ bin/ kprinter. & Netscape; will remember this and with further print jobs you will get the kprinter dialog to configure your printouts.
A screenshot of the kprinter print command in action.
Here's a screenshot showing how to use the new kprinter print command instead of the old-fashioned lp or lpr in & Netscape;.
Just make sure you give at least the file to be printed from the command line as well: kprinter / usr/ share/ doc/ packages/ cups/ sam. pdf. This will hand over the & CUPS; Software Administrator Manual to the kprinter dialog, which will then pop up with the default printer pre-selected.
To pre-select a specific printer from the command line, use the -d option, & eg;: kprinter -d DANKAcolorC2000 / home/ kurt/ linuxtag2001-paper. ps. You can still de-select the printer DANKAcolorC2000 and choose a different one.
The most important improvement in the near future will be a completion of the LPRng plugin. This at present is still very basic. It is restricted to the pure classical LPD part of LPRng.
Some smaller improvements already planned are:
Please contact Michael Goffioul at kdeprint@swing. be with any further user or developer suggestions.
Generic LPD Module (UNIX;)
Module used by default (on first start for example).
Generic module that only allows sending of print jobs. No printer or job management supported. It is made to work on a wide variety of & UNIX; flavors: & Linux; / LPR, & HP-UX;, Solaris, & IRIX;. It also supports some LPRng extensions (like the absence of continuation character\\ in printcap files).
LPR (BSD)
Plain (old?) LPR support. An LPRng module is in development, and hopefully available for 2.3 release.
Printer management: basic support to add/ remove/ configure a printer, compatible with & RedHat; -6. x systems (printtool + rhs-printfilers packages).
Job management: not supported
Print options: basic control
LPRng
An LPRng module for & kdeprint; is in development, and hopefully available for the & kde; 2.3 release.
Printer management: basic operations are supported (add/ remove/ modify).
Technical Overview
What it is not
& kdeprint; is not a replacement for the printing subsystem itself. & kdeprint; does not therefore give provision for spooling, and it does not do the basic processing of & PostScript; or other print data.
What it is
& kdeprint; is easy to use for both & kde; developers and end-users. Developers can port their applications, with minimal changes, to use & kdeprint; instead of the old & Qt; print system. Users can easily choose and configure their print subsystem.
For a reference to new & kde; users: & Qt; is the basic library and graphical toolkit, which is used by all & kde; applications; & Qt; is developed by TrollTech, a Norwegian software company.
& kdeprint; has different faces for different people.
& kdeprint; allows users and/ or administrators, depending on their rights, access to printing subsystems (CUPS;, LPD, RLPR, LPRng, PDQ & etc;) through a & kde; graphical user interface (GUI;). Using & kdeprint;, they can print, administer jobs, printers and the printing daemon, all in a comfortable manner.

What & kdeprint; offers to everybody...
& kdeprint; 's easy-to-use interface for all supported print subsystems of course does not eliminate basic traditional weaknesses of some of those systems. But it smooths some rough edges. Different users may use different printing systems on the same box. A user is free to even switch on the fly, from the print dialog, the print subsystem to be used for the next job. (This is possible if different systems are installed in a way that they do n't get in each other's way.)
& kdeprint; can use & CUPS; to support:
Querying the LAN for available printers,
Basic, Digest, and Certificate Authentication,
Access Control based on IP addresses, net addresses, netmasks, host- and domain names,
and 128-Bit TLS or SSL3 encryption of print data, to prevent eavesdropping, or at least make it much more difficult.
You get access to & kdeprint;, or parts of it, in four different ways:
through your applications: if you call the printing dialog (either File Print...) or the button with the little printer icon on it; this opens the printing dialog.
through the typed command kprinter in a terminal or a & konsole; window or from the Run Command... mini- CLI window: this also opens the printing dialog.
from a command line (konsole; or mini- CLI) type kcmshell printmgr. This opens just the & kdeprint; part of & kcontrol; to change your settings

Some Theoretical Background: & CUPS;, IPP, & PostScript; and Ghostscript
Printing is one of the more complicated chapters in IT technology.
Of course, over time, there came the development of other description methods. The most important competitors to & PostScript; were PCL (Print Control Language, from & Hewlett-Packard;), ESC/ P (from Epson) and GDI (Graphical Device Interface from & Microsoft;).
& PostScript; is most heavily used in professional printing environments such as PrePress and printing service industries. In the & UNIX; and & Linux; domains, & PostScript; is the predominant standard as a PDL. Here, nearly every program generates a & PostScript; representation of its pages once you push the Print button. Let us look at a simple example of (hand-made) & PostScript; code. The following listing describes two simple drawings:
& PostScript; Code
%! PS 100 100 moveto 0 50 rlineto 50 0 rlineto 0 -50 rlineto closepath .7 setgray fill% first box over; next 160 100 moveto 0 60 rlineto 45 10 rlineto 0 -40 rlineto closepath .2 setgray fill
Rendered & PostScript;
A & PostScript; file is a representation of one or more pages to be printed, in a relatively abstract way. Ideally, it is meant to describe the pages in a device-independent way. & PostScript; is not directly visible; it only lives on hard disks and in RAM as a coded representation of future printouts.
RIP: From & PostScript; to Raster
Before the final raster images are put on paper cut-sheets, they have to be calculated somehow out of their abstract & PostScript; representation. This is a very computing-intensive process. It is called the Raster Imaging Process, more commonly RIP).
With & PostScript; printers the RIP -ping is taken care of by the device itself. You just send the & PostScript; file to it. The Raster Imaging Processor (also called the RIP) inside the printer is responsible (and specialized) to fulfill quite well this task of interpreting the & PostScript; -page descriptions and put the raster image on paper.
Smaller & PostScript; devices have a hardware- RIP built in; it is etched in silicon, on a special chip. Big professional printers often have their RIP implemented as a software- RIP inside a dedicated fast & UNIX; run computer, often a Sun SPARC Solaris or a & SGI; & IRIX; machine.
Ghostscript as a Software RIP
Drivers and Filters in General
& PostScript; is what most application programs produce for printing in & UNIX; and & Linux;. Filters are the true workhorses of any printing system there. Essentially they produce the right bitmaps from any & PostScript; input for non-PostScript; target engines.

Spoolers and Printing Daemons
This daemon is keeping the house in order: it is also responsible for the job control: users should be allowed to cancel, stop, restart, & etc; their jobs (but not other peoples's jobs) and so on.
Excursion: How CUPS uses the power of & PPD; s
How Special & PPD; s are Now Useful Even For Non-PostScript; Printers.
Meanwhile there are a lot of & CUPS; -specific & PPD; s available. Even now those are in most cases not originating from the printer manufacturers, but from Free software developers. The & CUPS; folks proofed it, and others followed suit: where & Linux; and & UNIX; printing one or two years ago still was a kludge, it is now able to support a big range of printers, including 7-color inkjets capable of pushing them to Photo Quality output.
You can get & PPD; s to be used with & CUPS; and non-PostScript; printers from different areas in the Web:
third, there is the commercial extension to & CUPS; from the & CUPS; developers themselves: it is called ESP PrintPro and comes with more than 2.300 printer drivers. There are even improved imagetoraster and pstoraster filters included.
Read more about the exciting & CUPS; features in the available & CUPS; documentation at http: / /www. cups. org/ documentation. html and http: / /www. danka. de/ printpro/ faq. html. Also at http: / /www. linuxprinting. org/ is a universal repository for all issues related to & Linux; and & UNIX; printing.
LPD Must Die!
For a long time many developers were deeply dissatisfied with good old LPD. Quite a few new projects were started to improve printing: LPRng is the best known example. Others are PDQ, PPR, PLP, GNUlpr and RLPR. But none of the new programs were seen as a big shot; most of them are just implementing the same old LPD specification with a few (or many) new extensions, which again make them incompatible with each other.
Having seen the development of not just one, but different viable alternatives to venerable BSD -style LPD, Grant Taylor, author of the Linux Printing HOWTO, finally rallied the call LPD Must Die! in his Campaign To Abolish The Line Printer Daemon.
Along with the above, on the industry side of things, there were efforts to overcome the well-known weaknesses of LPD. It started with proprietary extensions to plain old LPD, and stretched as far as & Hewlett-Packard; 's attempt to establish & HP; JetDirect as a new standard for a network printing protocol. The result were even more incompatibilities.
The most striking advantage will be its integration into the existing set of other robust IP protocols. Being an extension of the proven and robust HTTP 1.1 protocol, for the special task of handling print file and related data, it is also very easy to plug in other standards as they are being developed and deployed:
Basic, Digest, and Certificate Authentication for users seeking access to print services.
SSL3 and TLS encryption for transferring data.
Bi directional communication of clients with print devices, using the HTTP / IPP; GET and POST mechanism.
LDAP directory service integration to keep a consistent database of available printers, their capabilities and page-costs, & etc;, as well as user passwords, ACL s & etc;.
Printer Plug'n'Play for Clients
Wrong. Just change one setting in the original & CUPS; box to make it a server. Install & CUPS; on five other boxes, as clients. By the time you turn back to your first client, you find the users happily playing with the settings for the dozen printers you had defined earlier on the server. Somehow magically the printers had appeared on all the Print dialogs of the five new & CUPS; client boxes.
So, how does this magic work?
Seeing Printers Not Installed Locally?
The answer is not complicated at all.
If a & CUPS; server is on the LAN, it broadcasts the names of all available printers to the LAN, using the UDP protocol and port 631. Port 631 is reserved as a well-known port by IANA (the Internet Assigning Numbers Authority) for & IPP; purposes. All & CUPS; clients listen to & CUPS; server info sent to their port 631. That's how they know about available printers, and that's how they learn about the path to the printers as well.
And more, the clients basically can administer and use any printer they see, just as if it was a locally installed one. Of course, you can set restrictions on it with access control lists & etc;, so that not any clients may use any printer as it likes.
Zero Administration, Load Balancing, and Failover Switching
Some other advanced features built into & CUPS; are the capacity to do load balancing.

& Advanced
Copy CD-Text from the source CD if available.
If this option is checked K3b will disable the source drive's ECC/ EDC error correction. This way sectors that are unreadable by intention can be read. This may be useful for cloning CDs with copy protection based on corrupted sectors.
This is the normal copy mode for DVD, Blu-ray, and most CD media types. It allows copying Audio CDs, multi and single session Data Media, and Enhanced Audio CDs (an Audio CD containing an additional data session). For VideoCDs please use the CD Cloning mode.
In CD Cloning mode K3b performs a raw copy of the CD. That means it does not care about the content but simply copies the CD bit by bit. It may be used to copy VideoCDs or CDs which contain erroneous sectors. Caution: Only single session CDs can be cloned.

No optical drive found.

Unable to find %1 executable
K3b uses cdrecord to actually write CDs.
Install the cdrtools package which contains cdrecord.
Used %1 version %2 is outdated
Although K3b supports all cdrtools versions since 1.10 it is highly recommended to at least use version 2.0.
Install a more recent version of the cdrtools.
%1 will be run with root privileges on kernel > = 2.6.8
Since Linux kernel 2.6.8 %1 will not work when run suid root for security reasons anymore.
%1 will be run without root privileges
It is highly recommended to configure cdrecord to run with root privileges, as then cdrecord runs with high priority that increases the overall stability of the burning process. As well as this, it allows the size of the burning buffer to be changed, and a lot of user problems can be solved this way.
K3b uses cdrdao to actually write CDs.
Install the cdrdao package.
K3b uses growisofs to actually write DVDs. Without growisofs you will not be able to write DVDs. Make sure to install at least version 5.10.
Install the dvd+rw-tools package.
K3b needs at least growisofs version 5.10 to write DVDs. All older versions will not work and K3b will refuse to use them.
Install a more recent version of %1.
K3b will not be able to copy DVDs on-the-fly or write a DVD+RW in multiple sessions using a growisofs version older than 5.12.
It is highly recommended to use growisofs 7.0 or higher. K3b will not be able to write a DVD+RW in multiple sessions using a growisofs version older than 7.0.
K3b uses dvd+rw-format to format DVD-RWs and DVD+RWs.
K3b needs at least mkisofs version 1.14. Older versions may introduce problems when creating data projects.
Device %1 - %2 is automounted.
Replace the automounting entries in / etc/ fstab with old-fashioned ones or use a user-space mounting solution like pmount or ivman.
No ATAPI writing support in kernel
The best and recommended solution is to enable ide-scsi (SCSI emulation) for all devices. This way you will not have any problems. Be aware that you may still enable DMA on ide-scsi emulated drives.
%1 %2 does not support ATAPI
The best and recommended solution is to enable ide-scsi (SCSI emulation) for all devices. This way you will not have any problems. Or you install (or select as the default) a more recent version of %1.
Install cdrdao > = 1.1.8 which supports writing to ATAPI devices directly.
The best, and recommended, solution is to use ide-scsi (SCSI emulation) for all writer devices: this way you will not have any problems; or, you can install (or select as the default) a more recent version of %1.
K3b will not be able to write DVD-R Dual Layer media using a growisofs version older than 6.0.
Install a more recent version of growisofs.
No write access to device %1
K3b needs write access to all the devices to perform certain tasks. Without it you might encounter problems with %1 - %2
Make sure you have write access to %1. In case you are not using devfs or udev click "Modify Permissions..." and setup permissions by hand.
DMA disabled on device %1 - %2
With most modern CD/ DVD/ BD devices enabling DMA highly increases read/ write performance. If you experience very low writing speeds this is probably the cause.
Enable DMA temporarily as root with'hdparm -d 1 %1 '.
To remove the user parameters for the external program %1 open the K3b settings page'Programs' and choose the tab'User Parameters'.
MP3 Audio Decoder plugin not found.
K3b could not load or find the MP3 decoder plugin. This means that you will not be able to create Audio CDs from MP3 files. Many Linux distributions do not include MP3 support for legal reasons.
To enable MP3 support, please install the MAD MP3 decoding library as well as the K3b MAD MP3 decoder plugin (the latter may already be installed but not functional due to the missing libmad). Some distributions allow installation of MP3 support via an online update tool.
System locale charset is ANSI_X3.4-1968
Your system's locale charset (i. e. the charset used to encode filenames) is set to ANSI_X3.4-1968. It is highly unlikely that this has been done intentionally. Most likely the locale is not set at all. An invalid setting will result in problems when creating data projects.
To properly set the locale charset make sure the LC_* environment variables are set. Normally the distribution setup tools take care of this.
Running K3b as root user
It is not recommended to run K3b under the root user account. This introduces unnecessary security risks.
Run K3b from a proper user account and setup the device and external tool permissions appropriately.
The latter can be done via "Modify Permissions...".
No problems found in system configuration.

Let K3b select the best-suited mode. This is the recommended selection.
Disk At Once or more properly Session At Once. The laser is never turned off while writing the CD or DVD. This is the preferred mode to write audio CDs since it allows pregaps other than 2 seconds. Not all writers support DAO. DVD-R(W)s written in DAO provide the best DVD-Video compatibility.
Track At Once should be supported by every CD writer. The laser will be turned off after every track. Most CD writers need this mode for writing multisession CDs.
RAW writing mode. The error correction data is created by the software instead of the writer device. Try this if your CD writer fails to write in DAO and TAO.
Incremental sequential is the default writing mode for DVD-R(W). It allows multisession DVD-R(W)s. It only applies to DVD-R(W).
Restricted Overwrite allows to use a DVD-RW just like a DVD-RAM or a DVD+RW. The media may just be overwritten. It is not possible to write multisession DVD-RWs in this mode but K3b uses growisofs to grow an ISO9660 filesystem within the first session, thus allowing new files to be added to an already burned disk.

Sets the front margin for sequence items.
Sets the rear margin for sequence items.
If Autodetect is: ON then K3b will set the correct VideoCD type. OFF then the correct VideoCD type needs to be set by the user. If you are not sure about the correct VideoCD type, it is best to turn Autodetect ON. If you want to force the VideoCD type, you must turn Autodetect OFF. This is useful for some standalone DVD players without SVCD support.
Rename "/ MPEG2" folder on SVCDs to (non-compliant) "/ MPEGAV". Enables the use of the (deprecated) signature "ENTRYSVD" instead of "ENTRYVCD" for the file "/ SVCD/ ENTRY. SVD".
Enables the use of the (deprecated) Chinese "/ SVCD/ TRACKS. SVD" format which differs from the format defined in the IEC-62107 specification. The differences are most exposed on SVCDs containing more than one video track.
Configuration parameters only available for VideoCD 2.0The engine works perfectly well when used as-is. You have the option to configure the VCD application. You can adapt the color and/ or the shape of the cursor and lots more.
Playback control, PBC, is available for Video CD 2.0 and Super Video CD 1.0 disc formats. PBC allows control of the playback of play items and the possibility of interaction with the user through the remote control or some other input device available.
Here you can specify that the folder SEGMENT should always be present. Some DVD players need the folder to give a faultless rendition.
Viewing Restriction may be interpreted by the playing device. The allowed range goes from 0 to 3.0 = unrestricted, free to view for all3 = restricted, content not suitable for ages under 18Actually, the exact meaning is not defined and is player dependant. Most players ignore that value.
This option allows customization of Gaps and Margins.
Used to set the track pre-gap for all tracks in sectors globally. The specification requires the pre-gaps to be at least 150 sectors long. Allowed value content: [0..300]. Default: 150.
Margins are used to compensate for inaccurate sector-addressing issues on CD-ROM media. Interestingly, they have been abandoned for Super Video CDs. For Video CD 1.0/ 1.1/ 2.0 this margin should be at least 15 sectors long. Allowed value content: [0..150]. Default: 30 for Video CD 1.0/ 1.1/ 2.0, otherwise (i. e. Super Video CD 1.0 and HQ-VCD 1.0) 0.

DOS Compatibility
The file system is optimized for usage on Linux/ Unix systems. This mainly means that it uses the Rock Ridge extensions to provide long filenames, symbolic links, and POSIX compatible file permissions.
The file system has additional UDF entries attached to it. This raises the maximal file size to 4 GB. Be aware that the UDF support in K3b is limited.
The file system is optimized for compatibility with old systems. That means file names are restricted to 8.3 characters and no symbolic links or file permissions are supported.

Joliet Extensions Disabled

Why does K3b offer 4.4 GB and 8.0 GB instead of 4.7 and 8.5 like it says on the media? A single layer DVD media has a capacity of approximately 4.4 GB which equals 4.4*10243 bytes. Media producers just calculate with 1000 instead of 1024 for advertising reasons. This results in 4.4*10243/ 10003 = 4.7 GB.

XviD
FFmpeg is an open-source project trying to support most video and audio codecs used these days. Its subproject libavcodec forms the basis for multimedia players such as xine or mplayer.
FFmpeg contains an implementation of the MPEG-4 video encoding standard which produces high quality results.
XviD is a free and open source MPEG-4 video codec. XviD was created by a group of volunteer programmers after the OpenDivX source was closed in July 2001.
XviD features MPEG-4 Advanced Profile settings such as b-frames, global and quarter pixel motion compensation, lumi masking, trellis quantization, and H.263, MPEG and custom quantization matrices.
XviD is a primary competitor of DivX (XviD being DivX spelled backwards). While DivX is closed source and may only run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, XviD is open source and can potentially run on any platform.
(Description taken from the Wikipedia article)
AC3, better known as Dolby Digital is standardized as ATSC A/ 52. It contains up to 6 total channels of sound.
With this setting K3b will create a two-channel stereo Dolby Digital audio stream.
With this setting K3b will use the Dolby Digital audio stream from the source DVD without changing it.
Use this setting to preserve 5.1 channel sound from the DVD.
MPEG1 Layer III is better known as MP3 and is the most used lossy audio format.
With this setting K3b will create a two-channel stereo MPEG1 Layer III audio stream.

Simulate
If this option is checked K3b will perform all writing steps with the laser turned off. This is useful, for example, to test a higher writing speed or whether your system is able to write on-the-fly. Caution: DVD+R(W) does not support simulated writing.
If this option is checked, K3b will write the CD in'disk at once 'mode as compared to'track at once' (TAO). It is always recommended to use DAO where possible. Caution: Track pregaps with a length other than 2 seconds are only supported in DAO mode.
Use Burnfree
If this option is checked, K3b will only create an image and not do any actual writing. The image can later be written to a CD/ DVD with most current writing programs (including K3b of course).
Create image
It is recommended to try a simulation first.
Remove image
If this option is checked, K3b will remove any created images after the writing has finished. Uncheck this if you want to keep the images.
If this option is checked, K3b will not create an image first but write the files directly to the CD/ DVD. Caution: Although this should work on most systems, make sure the data is sent to the writer fast enough.
Write CD-TEXT
Sets the correction mode for digital audio extraction.0: No checking, data is copied directly from the drive. 1: Perform overlapped reading to avoid jitter.2: Like 1 but with additional checks of the read audio data.3: Like 2 but with additional scratch detection and repair.

Features
DHT is a trackerless protocol to find peers sharing the same torrents as you do.
Use DHT to get additional peers
UDP port for DHT communications:
Whether or not to use µTorrent compatible peer exchange.
Enable or disable the use of webseeds when they are present in a torrent.
Use webseeds
Encryption
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Protocol encryption is useful when your ISP is slowing down bittorrent connections. The encryption will prevent your bittorrent traffic to be flagged as bittorrent traffic, and so the ISP will not slow it down.
Tracker
Instead of allowing the tracker to determine your IP address, tell the tracker which IP address to use. Use this when you are behind a proxy.
Custom IP address or hostname:
Custom IP address or hostname to send to the tracker. Hostnames will be resolved at runtime and the resolved IP address will be sent to the tracker.
Data Checking
KiB
When a torrent has finished downloading, do a full data check on the torrent.
When enabled, the queue manager will be totally disabled, allowing you to fully control all torrents manually.
Control torrents manually
When diskspace is running low:
Do n't start torrents
Ask if torrents can be started
Start torrents
Stop torrents when free disk space is lower than:
When the free diskspace drops below this value, stop all torrents downloading.
MiB
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} With this enabled, the queue manager will decrease the priority of a torrent which has been stalled for too long. This will allow the queue manager to run other torrents, when a torrent is doing nothing.
Minutes
Seeding
When a download is finished, continue seeding it. If this is disabled, the torrent will be stopped.
Default maximum share ratio:
Default maximum seed time:
The maximum seed time in hours. Once you reach this time, the torrent will be stopped. This is only applied to newly opened torrents, existing torrents will not be affected by changing this.
HTTP

Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
What do you know about the crash?
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
List of possible duplicate reports
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
Thank you for being part of KDE!
& Reload
Use this button to reload the crash information (backtrace). This is useful when you have installed the proper debug symbol packages and you want to obtain a better backtrace.
& Install Debug Symbols
Use this button to install the missing debug symbols packages.
Use this button to copy the crash information (backtrace) to the clipboard.
Use this button to save the crash information (backtrace) to a file. This is useful if you want to take a look at it or to report the bug later.
Loading crash information... (this may take some time)
Another debugger is currently debugging the same application. The crash information could not be fetched.
The crash information could not be fetched.
Another debugging process is attached to the crashed application. Therefore, the DrKonqi debugger cannot fetch the backtrace. Please close the other debugger and click Reload Crash Information.
This crash information is not useful
The rating of this crash information is invalid. This is a bug in drkonqi itself.
The debugger has quit unexpectedly.
The crash information could not be generated.
You could try to regenerate the backtrace by clicking the Reload Crash Information button.
The debugger application is missing or could not be launched.
You need to install the debugger package (%1) and click the Reload Crash Information button.

& Developer Information
We are sorry, %1 closed unexpectedly.

You can help us improve KDE Software by reporting this error. Learn more about bug reporting. It is safe to close this dialog if you do not want to report this bug.
You cannot report this error, because the application does not provide a bug reporting address.

When enabled blocked images will be removed from the page completely, otherwise a placeholder'blocked 'image will be used.
Enter an expression to filter. Filters can be defined as either: a shell-style wildcard, e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ads*, the wildcards *? [] may be useda full regular expression by surrounding the string with '/ ', e. g. / \\/ (ad_BAR_banner)\\. / Any filter string can be preceded by '@@' to whitelist (allow) any matching URL, which takes priority over any blacklist (blocking) filter.
The filter import format is a plain text file. Blank lines, comment lines starting with '!' and the header line [AdBlock] are ignored. Any other line is added as a filter expression.
Konqueror AdBlocK Konqueror AdBlocK allows you to create a list of filters that are checked against linked images and frames. URL's that match are either discarded or replaced with a placeholder image.

Unable to contact the KDE smartcard service.
Possible Reasons
1) The KDE daemon, 'kded 'is not running. You can restart it by running the command'kdeinit' and then try reloading the KDE System Settings to see if this message goes away. 2) You do not appear to have smartcard support in the KDE libraries. You will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed.
Smartcard Support
& Enable smartcard support
In most cases you should have this enabled. It allows KDE to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events.

Confirm logout
Here you can choose what should happen by default when you log out. This only has meaning, if you logged in through KDM.
On Login
Applications to be excluded from sessions:
Here you can enter a colon or comma separated list of applications that should not be saved in sessions, and therefore will not be started when restoring a session. For example'xterm: konsole 'or'xterm, konsole'.

Enable background
If this is checked, KDM will use the settings below for the background. If it is disabled, you have to look after the background yourself. This is done by running some program (possibly xsetroot) in the script specified in the Setup= option in kdmrc (usually Xsetup).

Enable Auto-Login
Turn on the auto-login feature. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
Select the user to be logged in automatically.
Lock session
The automatically started session will be locked immediately (provided it is a KDE session). This can be used to obtain a super-fast login restricted to one user.
& None
Previous
Preselect the user that logged in previously. Use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user.
Preselect the user specified in the combo box to the right. Use this if this computer is predominantly used by a certain user.
Select the user to be preselected for login. This box is editable, so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers.
Focus password
No password required for:
Check all users you want to allow a password-less login for. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Miscellaneous
This is the "headline" for KDM's login window. You may want to put some nice greeting or information about the operating system here. KDM will substitute the following character pairs with the respective contents: %d - > current display %h - > host name, possibly with domain name %n - > node name, most probably the host name without domain name %s - > the operating system %r - > the operating system's version %m - > the machine (hardware) type%% - > a single%

Autocompletion
If this option is checked, KDM will automatically complete user names while they are typed in the line edit.
Inverse selection
This option specifies how the users for "Show list" and "Autocompletion" are selected in the "Select users and groups" list: If not checked, select only the checked users. If checked, select all non-system users, except the checked ones.
Sort users
If this is checked, KDM will alphabetically sort the user list. Otherwise users are listed in the order they appear in the password file.
Select users and groups:
Selected Users
KDM will show all checked users. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Excluded Users
KDM will show all non-checked non-system users. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Here you can specify where KDM will obtain the images that represent users. "System" represents the global folder; these are the pictures you can set below. "User" means that KDM should read the user's $HOME/. face. icon file. The two selections in the middle define the order of preference if both sources are available.
User Images
The user the image below belongs to.
Here you can see the image assigned to the user selected in the combo box above. Click on the image button to select from a list of images or drag and drop your own image on to the button (e. g. from Konqueror).

kioclient openProperties'url '# Opens a properties menu
kioclient exec'url '['mimetype'] # Tries to open the document pointed to by'url ', in the application # associated with it in KDE. You may omit'mimetype'. # In this case the mimetype is determined # automatically. Of course URL may be the URL of a # document, or it may be a *. desktop file. # 'url 'can be an executable, too.
kioclient move'src ''dest' # Moves the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
# 'dest 'may be "trash: /" to move the files # to the trash.
# the short version kioclient mv # is also available.
kioclient download ['src '] # Copies the URL'src' to a user-specified location '. # 'src' may be a list of URLs, if not present then # a URL will be requested.
kioclient copy'src ''dest' # Copies the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kioclient cat'url '# Writes out the contents of'url' to stdout
kioclient remove'url '# Removes the URL # 'url' may be a list of URLs.
# the short version kioclient rm # is also available.
*** Examples: kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop "Mount default" / / Mounts the CDROM
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html / / Opens the file with default binding
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html Netscape / / Opens the file with netscape
kioclient exec ftp: / /localhost/ / / Opens new window with URL
kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ emacs. desktop / / Starts emacs

Konqueror makes working with and managing your files easy. You can browse both local and networked folders while enjoying advanced features such as the powerful sidebar and file previews.
To return to the previous location, press the back button in the toolbar.
To quickly go to your Home folder press the home button.
For more detailed documentation on Konqueror click here.
Tuning Tip: If you want the Konqueror web browser to start faster, you can turn off this information screen by clicking here. You can re-enable it by choosing the Help - > Konqueror Introduction menu option, and then pressing Settings - > Save View Profile As... - > "Web Browsing".
Next: Tips & Tricks
Konqueror is designed to embrace and support Internet standards. The aim is to fully implement the officially sanctioned standards from organizations such as the W3 and OASIS, while also adding extra support for other common usability features that arise as de facto standards across the Internet. Along with this support, for such functions as favicons, Web Shortcuts, and XBEL bookmarks, Konqueror also implements:
Supported standards
Additional requirements*
DOM (Level 1, partially Level 2) based HTML 4.01
built-in
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS 1, partially CSS 2)
ECMA-262 Edition 3 (roughly equals JavaScript 1.5)
Secure Java reg; support
JDK 1.2.0 (Java 2) compatible VM (Blackdown, IBM or Sun)
Enable Java (globally) here.
Netscape Communicator reg; plugins (for viewing Flash reg;, Real reg; Audio, Real reg; Video, etc.)
(TLS/ SSL v2/ 3) for secure communications up to 168bit
OpenSSL
Bidirectional 16bit unicode support

Use Web-Shortcuts: by typing "gg: KDE" one can search the Internet, using Google, for the search phrase "KDE". There are a lot of Web-Shortcuts predefined to make searching for software or looking up certain words in an encyclopedia a breeze. You can even create your own Web-Shortcuts.
You can also find "Full-Screen Mode" in the Settings menu. This feature is very useful for "Talk" sessions.
Divide et impera (lat. "Divide and conquer") - by splitting a window into two parts (e. g. Window - > Split View Left/ Right) you can make Konqueror appear the way you like. You can even load some example view-profiles (e. g. Midnight Commander), or create your own ones.
Use a caching proxy to speed up your Internet connection.
Advanced users will appreciate the Konsole which you can embed into Konqueror (Settings - > Show Terminal Emulator).

This is the command which will be executed to initialize configured layouts.
Here you can choose a variant of selected keyboard layout. Layout variants usually represent different key maps for the same language. For example, Ukrainian layout might have four variants: basic, winkeys (as in Windows), typewriter (as in typewriters) and phonetic (each Ukrainian letter is placed on a transliterated latin one).

PowerDevil Configuration
A configurator for PowerDevil
(c), 2008 Dario Freddi
From this module, you can configure the Daemon, create and edit powersaving profiles, and see your system's capabilities.
Another power manager has been detected. PowerDevil will not start if other power managers are active. If you want to use PowerDevil as your primary power manager, please remove the existing one and restart the PowerDevil service.
It seems powersaved is running on this system. PowerDevil will not start if other power managers are active. If you want to use PowerDevil as your primary power manager, please stop powersaved and restart the PowerDevil service.
PowerDevil seems not to be started. Either you have its service turned off, or there is a problem in D-Bus.
No scaling methods were found. If your CPU is reasonably recent, this is probably because you have not loaded some kernel modules. Usually scaling modules have names similar to cpufreq_ondemand. Scaling is useful and can save a lot of battery. Click on "Attempt Loading Modules" to let PowerDevil try to load the required modules. If you are sure your PC does not support scaling, you can also disable this warning by clicking "Do not display this warning again".
ConsoleKit was not found active on your PC, or PowerDevil cannot contact it. ConsoleKit lets PowerDevil detect whether the current session is active, which is useful if you have more than one user logged into your system at any one time.
No issues found with your configuration.
No kernel modules for CPU scaling were found. Either you do not have them installed, or PowerDevil could not detect them.

PowerDevil was compiled without Xss and Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. Determining idle time will not be possible. Please consider recompiling PowerDevil with at least one of these two libraries.
PowerDevil was compiled without Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. XSync grants extra efficiency and performance, saving your battery and CPU. It is advised to use PowerDevil with XSync enabled.
XSync does not seem to be your preferred query backend, though it is available on your system. Using it largely improves performance and efficiency, and is strongly advised. Click on the button below to enable it now.

Change scheduling priority for:
CPU Scheduler
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} The standard time-sharing scheduler for processes without special requirements.
Normal
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} For CPU-intensive non-interactive processes. Process is mildly disfavored in scheduling decisions.
Batch
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process will run whenever runnable. Higher priority than Normal or Batch. Has Timeslicing.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Round Robin Scheduling Round Robin is a simple enhancement of FIFO. Everything described below for FIFO also applies to Round Robin, except that each process is only allowed to run for a maximum time quantum.
Round robin
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process will run whenever runnable. Higher priority than Normal or Batch. No timeslicing.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} First In-First Out Scheduling When a FIFO process becomes runnable, it will always immediately preempt any currently running Normal or Batch process.
FIFO
I/ O Scheduler
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process's priority is based on the CPU priority.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Normal Scheduling This is the same as Best Effort scheduling, except that the priority is calculated automatically based on the CPU priority. Processes with a higher priority will take priority for access to the hard disk. Programs running at the same Best Effort/ Normal priority are served in a Round Robin fashion.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process can only use the hard disk when no other process has used it very recently.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Idle Scheduling A program running with Idle I/ O priority will only get disk time when no other program has asked for disk I/ O for a defined grace period. The impact of Idle I/ O processes on normal system activity should be zero. Priority is not applicable to this scheduling class.
Idle
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process is given higher priority to access the hard disk than Normal.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Best Effort Scheduling Processes with a higher priority will take priority for access to the hard disk. Programs running at the same Best Effort/ Normal priority are served in a Round Robin fashion.
Best effort
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process gets immediate access to the hard disk whenever needed, regardless of what else is going on.

Cathode Rays
Ionic Radius
The Ionic Radius is the radius of a charged atom, known as an ion. The ion can have a positive or a negative charge. The charge of the ion with the radius shown is also displayed in Kalzium. A positive ion has fewer electrons in its shell than the atom, a negative ion has more electrons. Therefore, a positive ion has a smaller radius than its atom and vice versa.

Wash Bottle
These bottles are used for many purposes. In most laboratories they are usually filled with water, salt, acid or other commonly used fluids. They make it easy to apply the fluid if a precisely measured amount is not needed.
Rotary Evaporator
Reflux Condenser
Pipette Bulb
Test Tube
Protective Goggles
Most laboratories insist that protective goggles are worn. Without them, it is too risky to work with most chemicals. Usually, the lens is a special type of plastic that affords protection from both mechanical impacts, and acid and base chemicals.
Round-Bottomed Flask
A round-bottomed flask is used for many reactions. Some can be connected to other items, as the frosting on the neck shows. With cork rings they can be placed on a table.
Full Pipette
Drying Tube
Measuring Cylinder
A measuring cylinder can be used to measure amounts of liquids relatively precisely. Furthermore, the cylinder allows particulate matter to sink: following this, the particulates can be separated from the fluid by decanting.
Thermometer
A thermometer can be used to determine the temperature of a sample. In a laboratory, special thermometers are used which can also be used within acids or bases.
Magnetic stir bars are highly chemically inert, small magnetic bars. Most heaters have a built-in magnet which can rotate: this causes the stir bar to rotate and the mixture to become homogenized.
Pipette
Erlenmeyer Flask
Scales
Distillation bridge
Syringe
A syringe consists of two parts, a glass tube and a plunger, both normally made of glass. Gasses flow into the glass tube, and as the syringe is a closed system, the plunger moves outwards. This can be used to measure the volume of a reaction.
Separation Beaker
Burner
There are several types of burners; this picture shows a Teclu-Burner. Each type of burner has specific uses, and they vary in peak temperature and overall heating capacity.

Beaker
Beakers can be used for many tasks. For instance, they are used to store chemicals and to perform chemical reactions. They are often also used for titrations.
DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimeter)
A DSC measures the heat flow volume of a compound. This value is very specific for every kind of matter, and thus a DSC can be used to identify chemicals or to describe them.

One of the most powerful tools in Kig are the menus that you can enter by right-clicking on an object, or on some empty space in the document. You can use them to give objects names, change their colors and line styles, and lots of other interesting things.
You can construct new points without using the menu or the toolbar, simply clicking somewhere on the Kig document with the middle mouse button.
Kig can open several file formats: its files (. kig files), KGeo files, KSeg files, and, partially, Dr. Geo and Cabri#8482; files.
Kig has more than 20 objects and 10 transformations with more than 80 constructions you can use in your documents: open the Objects menu to see them all.
Kig can extends its object set using external macros. You can find some interesting macros on the Kig website: http: / /edu. kde. org/ kig.
When you construct a locus, you can click on it with the right mouse button and select cartesian equation to see its cartesian equation, whenever it is an algebraic curve of low degree.

Score
This is your score. You should try to get the lowest possible. The score increases: with time: 1 point per second. with the use of lasers: 3 points if the laser beam hits a ball or exits at the entry point, 9 points if it exits at another entry point. Your score is set to 999 at the end of the game if you make a mistake.
This is the main game area. The black box is in the center. On the left, there are the balls you have to place over the black box. Around the black box, there are lasers that are replaced with interaction information if you use them.
Displays the progress of the tutorial.
& Previous
Go back to the previous tutorial step.
& Next
Go to the next tutorial step.
This tutorial will teach you how to play KBlackBox, using a simple example. We are playing with a square black box of 6 columns and 6 rows. It has 3 balls hidden inside it and 24 laser probes around it. The goal is to find the positions of the balls.
Click on "Next"
No interaction
If a laser beam does not interact with any ball in the black box, it comes out at the point opposite the entry point. Example: Suppose we have 3 balls in the box as shown. They will not affect laser beam "1". As the game progresses, each pair of entry/ exit points is marked with a different number.
Now shoot the marked laser to discover the first kind of interaction.
Hit
A direct impact on a ball is called a "hit". A beam that hits a ball does not emerge from the black box. Example: The beam might have hit a ball at the position shown, but the exact position of the hit is not certain: There are many other possibilities.
Shoot the marked laser to discover the second kind of interaction.
Simple deflection
The interaction of a beam that does not actually hit a ball, but aims to one side of it, is called a "deflection". The angle of deflection of the beam is always 90 degrees. Example: The ball shown would deflect beam "2" upward, as shown, but this is not the only possibility.
Several deflections
Shoot the marked laser to discover another kind of result.
Reflection
If the laser beam leaves the black box at the entry point, it has been reflected backward inside the black box. Example: We have placed 2 balls for you in a configuration that would lead to such a reflection.
Shoot the marked laser to see another backward reflection case.
Special reflection
Marker for "free position"
We are sure there are no balls in the first 2 columns. If there were any, the beam entering at position "1" would hit a ball or be deflected by a ball in column 2. You can mark a "free position" with a right mouse click (see also keyboard shortcuts). Example: There are 12 markers in the first 2 columns.
Click on "Next".
Marking balls
When you have worked out where a ball is, please use the left mouse button to mark it. To remove a ball mark, use the left mouse button again. Last tip: If you are not sure about a position, you can use a right click on a ball to mark it as "unsure". (See also keyboard shortcuts.) Example: We marked one position as sure, the other one as unsure.
Let us play!
Congratulations! You now know all the rules for KBlackBox. You can start to play. Try to finish this tutorial game by yourself! Tip: We have sent in enough beams to deduce the positions of the 3 balls with certainty. Of course, you can use some more shots if needed.
Finish placing the balls and click on "Done!" when you are done!

Gravity Checking this makes the game even harder: If a tile is removed, all tiles lying above it will fall down one step.
Allow unsolvable games If checked, you run the risk of being presented with games that are impossible to solve. Note: Even if not checked, you will fail to complete a game if you remove the tiles in the wrong order!

Text Fields provide extra information about the image. This is probably a comment area that you can freely write any text in. However, this is format-specific so the fields could theoretically be computer-interpreted data - that you should not modify - but this is unlikely. Not all image formats support Text Fields. If the format you save in does not support them, they will not be saved.

16 bits color depth
If enabled, all RAW files will be decoded in 16-bit color depth using a linear gamma curve. To prevent dark picture rendering in the editor, it is recommended to use Color Management in this mode. If disabled, all RAW files will be decoded in 8-bit color depth with a BT.709 gamma curve and a 99th-percentile white point. This mode is faster than 16-bit decoding.

Aborts the font generation. Do not do this.
Okular is generating fonts. Please wait.
Okular was not able to locate all the font files which are necessary to display the current DVI file. Your document might be unreadable.
Locating fonts...
Okular relies on the kpsewhich program to locate font files on your hard disk and to generate PK fonts, if necessary.
The font generation by kpsewhich was aborted (exit code %1, error %2). As a result, some font files could not be located, and your document might be unreadable.
Currently generating %1 at %2 dpi
The DVI file does not start with the preamble.
The DVI file contains the wrong version of DVI output for this program. Hint: If you use the typesetting system Omega, you have to use a special program, such as oxdvi.
The DVI file is badly corrupted. Okular was not able to find the postamble.
The postamble does not begin with the POST command.
The postamble contained a command other than FNTDEF.
The page %1 does not start with the BOP command.
The PDF-file %1 could not be converted to PostScript. Some graphic elements in your document will therefore not be displayed. Possible reason: The file %1 might be broken, or might not be a PDF-file at all. This is the output of the pdf2ps program that Okular used: %2
Cannot find font %1, file %2.
Checksum mismatch for font file %1
Cannot open font file %1.
TexFont_PK: :operator[]: Character %1 not defined in font %2
Unexpected %1 in PK file %2
Wrong number of bits stored: char. %1, font %2
Bad pk file (%1), too many bits

Using dvipdfm to export the file to PDF
Okular is currently using the external program'dvipdfm 'to convert your DVI-file to PDF. Sometimes that can take a while because dvipdfm needs to generate its own bitmap fonts Please be patient.
Waiting for dvipdfm to finish...
Export: %1 to PDF
Functionality Unavailable
Okular could not locate the program'dvips' on your computer. That program is essential for the export function to work. Hint to the perplexed system administrator: Okular uses the PATH environment variable when looking for programs.

What is happening here?
%v of %m
The font file %1 could be opened and read, but its font format is unsupported.
FreeType reported an error when setting the character size for font file %1.
FreeType is unable to load glyph #%1 from font file %2.
FreeType is unable to render glyph #%1 from font file %2.
Glyph #%1 from font file %2 is empty.
FreeType is unable to load metric for glyph #%1 from font file %2.
File corruption Okular could not interpret your DVI file. This is most commonly caused by a corrupted file.
DVI File Error
That makes 25 errors. Further error messages will not be printed.
Error in DVIfile '%1 ', page %2. Color pop command issued when the color stack is empty.
Malformed parameter in the epsf special command. Expected a float to follow %1 in %2

© 2006 Luigi Toscano
Generator/ Date
The version of Ghostview that is installed on this computer does not contain any of the Ghostview device drivers that are known to Okular. PostScript support has therefore been turned off in Okular.
The DVI code set a character of an unknown font.
The stack was not empty when the EOP command was encountered.
The stack was empty when a POP command was encountered.
The DVI code referred to a font which was not previously defined.
An illegal command was encountered.
The unknown op-code %1 was encountered.
This probably means that either you found a bug in Okular, or that the DVI file, or auxiliary files (such as font files, or virtual font files) were really badly broken. Okular will abort after this message. If you believe that you found a bug, or that Okular should behave better in this situation please report the problem.
The fontlist is currently empty.

Further Notes
The entries are accessible through the submenu Commands in the Tools menu. For faster access it is possible to assign shortcuts in the shortcut configuration page after applying the changes.
Edit Command
& Associated command:
Choose an icon.
This icon will be displayed in the menu and toolbar.
Select the filetype you want to change.
Create a new file type.
& New
Delete the current file type.
This string allows to configure Kate's settings for the files selected by this mimetype using Kate variables. Almost any configuration option can be set, such as highlight, indent-mode, encoding, etc. For a full list of known variables, see the manual.
& Indentation Mode:
The wildcards mask allows to select files by filename. A typical mask uses an asterisk and the file extension, for example *. txt; *. text. The string is a semicolon-separated list of masks.
MIME & types:
The mime type mask allows to select files by mimetype. The string is a semicolon-separated list of mimetypes, for example text/ plain; text/ english.
Displays a wizard that helps you easily select mimetypes.
Sets priority for this file type. If more than one file type selects the same file, the one with the highest priority will be used.
Sets the background color of the editing area.
Sets the background color of the selection. To set the text color for selected text, use the "Configure Highlighting" dialog.
Select the marker type you want to change.
Sets the background color of the selected marker type. Note: The marker color is displayed lightly because of transparency.
Additional Elements
Left border background:
Sets the bracket matching color. This means, if you place the cursor e. g. at a (, the matching) will be highlighted with this color.
Word wrap markers:
Tab and space markers:
Sets the color of the tabulator marks.
Spelling mistake line:
When selected, the vi input mode will be enabled when opening a new view. You can still toggle the vi input mode on/ off for a particular view in the Edit menu.
Use Vi input mode
When selected, vi commands will override Kate's built-in commands. For example: Ctrl+R will redo, and override the standard action (showing the search and replace dialog).
Let Vi commands override Kate shortcuts
By default, an extra status bar will be used when the Vi input mode is enabled. This status bar shows commands while they are being typed and messages/ errors produced by Vi commands. Checking this options will hide this extra status line.
Key mapping is used to change the meaning of typed keys. This allows you to move commands to other keys or make special keypresses for doing a series of commands. Example: ""→" I--< esc > "This will prepend "--" to a line when pressing F2.
Key Mapping

Carsten Duvenhorst
Cool artist - example audio file. wav
Audio CDs The Audio CD IO-Slave enables you to easily create wav, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis files from your audio CD-ROMs or DVDs. The slave is invoked by typing "audiocd: /" in Konqueror's location bar. In this module, you can configure encoding, and device settings. Note that MP3 and Ogg Vorbis encoding are only available if KDE was built with a recent version of the LAME or Ogg Vorbis libraries.

Somebody is requesting a connection to your computer. Granting this will allow the remote user to watch your desktop.
If you turn this option on, the remote user can enter keystrokes and use your mouse pointer. This gives them full control over your computer, so be careful. When the option is disabled the remote user can only watch your screen.
This is the port on which krfb will listen.
Allow remote connections to manage the desktop.

This option enables interval checking of certificate validity. You can also choose the checking interval (in hours). Note that validation is perfomed implicitly whenever significant files in ~/. gnupg change. This option therefore only affects external factors of certificate validity.
hour
hours
If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
Validate certificates using CRLs
If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated online using the Online Certificates Status Protocol (OCSP). Fill in the URL of the OCSP responder below.
Validate certificates online (OCSP)
Enter here the address of the server for online validation of certificates (OCSP responder). The URL is usually starting with http: / /.
OCSP responder signature:
Ignore service URL of certificates
By default GnuPG uses the file ~/. gnupg/ policies. txt to check if a certificate policy is allowed. If this option is selected, policies are not checked.
If this option is checked, Certificate Revocation Lists are never used to validate S/ MIME certificates.
Never consult a CRL
If this option is checked, missing issuer certificates are fetched when necessary (this applies to both validation methods, CRLs and OCSP).
& HTTP Requests
Entirely disables the use of HTTP for S/ MIME.
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.
Ignore HTTP CRL distribution point of certificates
Use system HTTP proxy:
Use this proxy for HTTP requests:
Enter here the location of your HTTP Proxy, which will be used for all HTTP requests relating to S/ MIME. The syntax is host: port, for instance myproxy. nowhere. com:3128.
& LDAP Requests
Entirely disables the use of LDAP for S/ MIME.
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL.

Quoted Printable
Base 64
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

Account & name:
Account name: This defines the name displayed in KMail's account list.
Incoming mail & server:
The address of the mail server, e. g. mail. yourprovider. org. You should get this address from your mail provider.
Port: Defines the communication port with the mail server. You do not need to change this unless your mail provider uses some non-standard port.
Your Internet Service Provider gave you a user name which is used to authenticate you with their servers. It usually is the first part of your email address (the part before @).
The password given to you by your mail provider.
Check this option to have KMail store the password. If KWallet is available the password will be stored there which is considered safe. However, if KWallet is not available, the password will be stored in KMail's configuration file. The password is stored in an obfuscated format, but should not be considered secure from decryption efforts if access to the configuration file is obtained.

Activate this to load attachments not automatically when you select the email but only when you click on the attachment. This way also big emails are shown instantly.
Only folders that are open (expanded) in the folder tree are checked for subfolders. Use this if there are many folders on the server.
Here you see the different namespaces that your IMAP server supports. Each namespace represents a prefix that separates groups of folders. Namespaces allow KMail for example to display your personal folders and shared folders in one account.
Reload the namespaces from the server. This overwrites any changes.

Personal namespaces include your personal folders.

If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
Validate certificates using CRLs
If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated online using the Online Certificates Status Protocol (OCSP). Fill in the URL of the OCSP responder below.
Validate certificates online (OCSP)
OCSP responder signature:
Enter here the address of the server for online validation of certificates (OCSP responder). The URL is usually starting with http: / /.
Ignore service URL of certificates
By default GnuPG uses the file ~/. gnupg/ policies. txt to check if a certificate policy is allowed. If this option is selected, policies are not checked.
If this option is checked, Certificate Revocation Lists are never used to validate S/ MIME certificates.
Never consult a CRL
HTTP Requests
Entirely disables the use of HTTP for S/ MIME.
Do not perform any HTTP requests
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.

Use system HTTP proxy:
Use this proxy for HTTP requests:
Enter here the location of your HTTP Proxy, which will be used for all HTTP requests relating to S/ MIME. The syntax is host: port, for instance myproxy. nowhere. com:3128.

Troubleshooting IMAP Cache
Troubleshooting the IMAP Cache If you have problems with synchronizing an IMAP folder, you should first try rebuilding the index file. This will take some time to rebuild, but will not cause any problems. If that is not enough, you can try refreshing the IMAP cache. If you do this, you will lose all your local changes for this folder and all its subfolders.

... that you can get rid of the & quot; [mailing list name]quot; added to the subject of some mailing lists by using the rewrite header filter action? Just use rewrite header & quot; Subjectquot; replace & quot; \\s*\\[mailing list name\\]\\s*quot; with & quot; quot;

Archive/ Delete Past Events and To-dos
& Archive
Archiving saves old items into the given file and then deletes them in the current calendar. If the archive file already exists they will be added. (How to restore)
Archive now items older than:
The date before which items should be archived. All older events and to-dos will be saved and deleted, the newer (and events exactly on that date) will be kept.
Automatically archive items older than:
If this feature is enabled, KOrganizer will regularly check if events and to-dos have to be archived; this means you will not need to use this dialog box again, except to change the settings.
The age of the events and to-dos to archive. All older items will be saved and deleted, the newer will be kept.
Month(s)
*. ics_BAR_iCalendar Files
The path of the archive. The events and to-dos will be added to the archive file, so any events that are already in the file will not be modified or deleted. You can later load or merge the file like any other calendar. It is not saved in a special format, it uses the iCalendar format.
Type of Items to Archive
Here you can select which items should be archived. Events are archived if they ended before the date given above; to-dos are archived if they were finished before the date.
& Delete only, do not save
Select this option to delete old events and to-dos without saving them. It is not possible to recover the events later.

KArmReminder
(c) 2006
Someone, probably you, has called karm.
KArm has been renamed to KTimeTracker. This makes it easier to recognize. Compatibility advice: Do not give ktimetracker files to karm users. Using karm files with ktimetracker is possible.
Please learn to call ktimetracker as this reminder may be removed in the future.

Quoted Printable
Base 64
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

Kate comes with a nice set of plugins, providing simple and advanced features of all sorts. You can enable/ disable plugins to suit your needs in the configuration dialog, choose Settings -gt; configure to launch that.
You can export the current document as a HTML file, including syntax highlighting. Just choose File -gt; Export -gt; HTML...
You can split the Kate editor as many times as you like and in either direction. Each frame has its own status bar and can display any open document. Just choose View -gt; Split [Horizontal _BAR_ Vertical]
Kate has a built-in terminal emulator, just click on "Terminal" at the bottom to show or hide it as you desire.
Kate can highlight the current line with a different background color. _BAR_ You can set the color in the Colors page of the configuration dialog.
You can open the currently edited file in any other application from within Kate. Choose File -gt; Open With for the list of programs configured for the document type. There is also an option Other... to choose any application on your system.
You can download new or updated Syntax highlight definitions from the Highlighting page in the configuration dialog. Just click the Download... button on the Open/ Save -gt; Modes & Filetypes tab (You have to be online, of course...).
You can cycle through all open documents by pressing Alt+Left or Alt+Right. The next/ previous document will immediately be displayed in the active frame.
You can do cool sed-like regular expression replacements using Command Line. For example, press F7 and enter s / oldtext/ newtext/ g to replace & quot; oldtextquot; with & quot; newtextquot; throughout the current line.
You can repeat your last search by just pressing F3, or Shift+F3 if you want to search backwards.
You can filter the files displayed in the File Selector tool view. Simply enter your filter in the filter entry at the bottom, for example: *. html *. php if you only want to see HTML and PHP files in the current folder. The File Selector will even remember your filters for you .< strong >
You can have two views - or even more - of the same document in Kate. Editing in either will be reflected in both. So if you find yourself scrolling up and down to look at text at the other end of a document, just press Ctrl+Shift+T to split horizontally.
Press F8 or Shift+F8 to switch to the next/ previous frame.

This string is used as the template's name and is displayed, for example, in the Template menu. It should describe the meaning of the template, for example'HTML Document '.
The group is used for choosing a submenu for the plugin. If it is empty, 'Other 'is used. You can type any string to add a new group to your menu.
Document & name:
This string will be used to set a name for the new document, to display in the title bar and file list. If the string contains '%N ', that will be replaced with a number increasing with each similarly named file. For example, if the Document Name is'New shellscript (%N). sh', the first document will be named'New shellscript (1). sh ', the second'New shellscipt (2). sh', and so on.
None
Select the highlight to use for the template. If'None 'is chosen, the property will not be set.
This string is used, for example, as context help for this template (such as the'whatsthis' help for the menu item.)
You can set this if you want to share your template with other users. the recommended form is like an Email address: 'Anders Lund & lt; anders@alweb. dkgt; '

Do n't run with scissors.
Never trust car salesmen or politicians.
Real programmers do n't comment their code. It was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.
You can never have too much memory or disk space.
The answer is 42.
It's not a bug. It's a misfeature.
Help stamp out and abolish redundancy.
You can use Alt+Tab to switch between applications.
Press Ctrl+Esc to show the applications running in your current session.
Alt+F2 displays a small window that you can type a command into.
Ctrl+F1 to Ctrl+F8 can be used to switch virtual desktops.
You can move buttons on the panel using the middle mouse button.
Alt+F1 pops-up the system menu.
Ctrl+Alt+Esc can be used to kill an application that has stopped responding.
The KDE file manager is also a web browser and an FTP client.
Applications can display messages and tips in an Amor bubble using the showMessage() and showTip() DCOP calls

... that you can import and export MathML files?
... to get the most out of KFormula you need to install the TrueType version of the famous TeX fonts. You can find them in ctan at / tex-archive/ fonts/ cm/ ps-type1/ bakoma/. However you do n't need to install all of those. Right now the fonts cmbx10, cmex10, cmmi10, cmr10, cmsy10, msam10 and msbm10 are required.
... that you can use the keys ^ and _ to create right upper and lower indices? If you type Ctrl-^ or Ctrl-_ instead, you will get a left index.
... that you can insert any of the many supported symbols by typing its name? Simply press the backslash key, type the symbol's name and press space.
... that you can insert any number of lines using the Multiline element? By inserting you can align these lines.

The person responsible for this task. This is not limited to persons available in a resource group but can be anyone. You can even directly access your address book with the Choose button.
Insert a person from your address book.
Scheduling Configuration. These settings affect the actual scheduling of the task. The estimation can be either effort based or duration based. If it is effort based, the final duration will depend on the resources assigned to the task. For duration based estimation, the assigned resources do n't affect the fixed duration of the task, but only the costs.
Timing
Risk controls the PERT distribution used when calculating the actual estimate for this task.
Risk controls the PERT distribution used when calculating the actual estimate for the task. None means the Expected estimate is used as is. Low risk means that a normal distribution is used. High risk means that the estimate will be slightly pessimistic compared to Low risk.

The maximum number of "tiles" that are kept in memory. For regular RGBA8 images, each tile is about 16 kB in size. Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.
Maximum number of tiles kept in memory:
This configures how much Krita likes to swap. Move the slider to the left, and there is no swapping at all. Move it to the right there is a lot of swapping going on.

Rendering intent determines the bias in the color conversion.
Rendering Intent
Hue hopefully maintained (but not required), lightness and saturation sacrificed to maintain the perceived color. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for images.
Within and outside gamut; same as Absolute Colorimetric. White point changed to result in neutral grays.
Relative colorimetric
Hue and saturation maintained with lightness sacrificed to maintain saturation. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for business graphics (make it colorful charts, graphs, overheads,...)
Within the destination device gamut; hue, lightness and saturation are maintained. Outside the gamut; hue and lightness are maintained, saturation is sacrificed. White point for source and destination; unchanged. Intended for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...)

Server name (ServerName) The hostname of your server, as advertised to the world. By default CUPS will use the hostname of the system. To set the default server used by clients, see the client. conf file. ex: myhost. domain. com
Server administrator (ServerAdmin) The email address to send all complaints or problems to. By default CUPS will use "root@hostname". ex: root@myhost. com
Access log (AccessLog) The access log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ access_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ access_log
Data directory (DataDir) The root directory for the CUPS data files. By default / usr/ share/ cups. ex: / usr/ share/ cups
Default character set (DefaultCharset) The default character set to use. If not specified, defaults to utf-8. Note that this can also be overridden in HTML documents... ex: utf-8
Default language (DefaultLanguage) The default language if not specified by the browser. If not specified, the current locale is used. ex: en
Document directory (DocumentRoot) The root directory for HTTP documents that are served. By default the compiled-in directory. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ doc
Error log (ErrorLog) The error log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ error_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ error_log
Font path (FontPath) The path to locate all font files (currently only for pstoraster). By default / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts
Max log size (MaxLogSize) Controls the maximum size of each log file before they are rotated. Defaults to 1048576 (1MB). Set to 0 to disable log rotating. ex: 1048576
Page log (PageLog) The page log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ page_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ page_log
Preserve job history (PreserveJobHistory) Whether or not to preserve the job history after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is Yes. ex: Yes
Preserve job files (PreserveJobFiles) Whether or not to preserve the job files after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is No. ex: No
Printcap file (Printcap) The name of the printcap file. Default is no filename. Leave blank to disable printcap file generation. ex: / etc/ printcap
Request directory (RequestRoot) The directory where request files are stored. By default / var/ spool/ cups. ex: / var/ spool/ cups
Remote root user (RemoteRoot) The name of the user assigned to unauthenticated accesses from remote systems. By default "remroot". ex: remroot
Server binaries (ServerBin) The root directory for the scheduler executables. By default / usr/ lib/ cups or / usr/ lib32/ cups (IRIX 6.5). ex: / usr/ lib/ cups
User (User) The user the server runs under. Normally this must be lp, however you can configure things for another user as needed. Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the default IPP port of 631. It changes users whenever an external program is run... ex: lp
Group (Group) The group the server runs under. Normally this must be sys, however you can configure things for another group as needed. ex: sys
RIP cache (RIPCache) The amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache bitmaps. The value can be any real number followed by "k" for kilobytes, "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, or "t" for tiles (1 tile = 256x256 pixels). Defaults to "8m" (8 megabytes). ex: 8m
Temporary files (TempDir) The directory to put temporary files in. This directory must be writable by the user defined above! Defaults to "/ var/ spool/ cups/ tmp" or the value of the TMPDIR environment variable. ex: / var/ spool/ cups/ tmp
Filter limit (FilterLimit) Sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time. A limit of 0 means no limit. A typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200; limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time. The default limit is 0 (unlimited). ex: 200
Hostname lookups (HostNameLookups) Whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a fully-qualified hostname. This defaults to Off for performance reasons... ex: On
Keep alive (KeepAlive) Whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection option. Default is on. ex: On
Keep-alive timeout (KeepAliveTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) before Keep-Alive connections are automatically closed. Default is 60 seconds. ex: 60
Max clients (MaxClients) Controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that will be handled. Defaults to 100. ex: 100
Max request size (MaxRequestSize) Controls the maximum size of HTTP requests and print files. Set to 0 to disable this feature (defaults to 0). ex: 0
Client timeout (Timeout) The timeout (in seconds) before requests time out. Default is 300 seconds. ex: 300
Use browsing (Browsing) Whether or not to listen to printer information from other CUPS servers. Enabled by default. Note: to enable the sending of browsing information from this CUPS server to the LAN, specify a valid BrowseAddress. ex: On
Use short names (BrowseShortNames) Whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers when possible (e. g. "printer" instead of "printer@host"). Enabled by default. ex: Yes
Browse addresses (BrowseAddress) Specifies a broadcast address to be used. By default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces. Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i. e. no CIDR support). ex: x. y. z.255, x. y.255.255
Browse order (BrowseOrder) Specifies the order of BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny comparisons. ex: allow, deny
Browse port (BrowsePort) The port used for UDP broadcasts. By default this is the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers. Only one BrowsePort is recognized. ex: 631
Browse relay (BrowseRelay) Relay browser packets from one address/ network to another. ex: src-address dest-address
Browse timeout (BrowseTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we do n't get an update within this time the printer will be removed from the printer list. This number definitely should not be less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons. Defaults to 300 seconds. ex: 300
System group (SystemGroup) The group name for "System" (printer administration) access. The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be sys, system, or root (checked for in that order). ex: sys
Encryption certificate (ServerCertificate) The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt
Encryption key (ServerKey) The file to read containing the server's key. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key
Class (AuthClass) The authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
The user/ group names allowed to access the resource. The format is a comma separated list.
Authentication group name (AuthGroupName) The group name for Group authorization.
Access permissions Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
Auto purge jobs (AutoPurgeJobs) Automatically purge jobs when not needed for quotas. Default is No.
Classification (Classification) The classification level of the server. If set, this classification is displayed on all pages, and raw printing is disabled. The default is the empty string. ex: confidential
Allow overrides (ClassifyOverride) Whether to allow users to override the classification on printouts. If enabled, users can limit banner pages to before or after the job, and can change the classification of a job, but cannot completely eliminate the classification or banners. The default is off.
Hide implicit members (HideImplicitMembers) Whether or not to show the members of an implicit class. When HideImplicitMembers is On, any remote printers that are part of an implicit class are hidden from the user, who will then only see a single queue even though many queues will be supporting the implicit class. Enabled by default.
Max jobs (MaxJobs) Maximum number of jobs to keep in memory (active and completed). Default is 0 (no limit).
Port The port value that the CUPS daemon is listening to. Default is 631.
Address The address that the CUPS daemon is listening at. Leave it empty or use an asterisk (*) to specify a port value on the entire subnetwork.
Check this box if you want to use SSL encryption with this address/ port.

Print queue on remote CUPS server Use this for a print queue installed on a remote machine running a CUPS server. This allows to use remote printers when CUPS browsing is turned off.
Network IPP printer Use this for a network-enabled printer using the IPP protocol. Modern high-end printers can use this mode. Use this mode instead of TCP if your printer can do both.
Fax/ Modem printer Use this for a fax/ modem printer. This requires the installation of the fax4CUPS backend. Documents sent on this printer will be faxed to the given target fax number.
Other printer Use this for any printer type. To use this option, you must know the URI of the printer you want to install. Refer to the CUPS documentation for more information about the printer URI. This option is mainly useful for printer types using 3rd party backends not covered by the other possibilities.
Class of printers Use this to create a class of printers. When sending a document to a class, the document is actually sent to the first available (idle) printer in the class. Refer to the CUPS documentation for more information about class of printers.

The supported tags are: %filterargs: command options %filterinput: input specification %filteroutput: output specification %psu: the page size in upper case %psl: the page size in lower case
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from a file. Use the tag %in to represent the input filename.
Output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to a file. Use the tag %out to represent the output filename.
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from its standard input.

Selection tool
This will change the state of the editor to selection state. In this state you will not be inserting regexp items, but instead select them. To select a number of items, press down the left mouse button and drag it over the items. When you have selected a number of items, you may use cut/ copy/ paste. These functions are found in the right mouse button menu.
Text
This will insert a text field, where you may write text. The text you write will be matched literally. (i. e. you do not need to escape any characters)
Any character
Repeated content
This regexp item will match any of its alternatives. Alternatives are specified by placing regexp items on top of each other inside this widget.
Compound regexp
This regexp item serves two purposes: It makes it possible for you to collapse a huge regexp item into a small box. This makes it easier for you to get an overview of large regexp items. This is especially useful if you load a predefined regexp item that you perhaps do not care about the inner workings of.
This will match the beginning of a line.
